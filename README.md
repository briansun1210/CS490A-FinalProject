# CS490A-FinalProject
Code for final project 

Using pip install to install necessary library.
.ipynb files are the codes

*Preprocessing:
Annotating data (different class groupings)
Tokenizing (scispacy, BERTTokenizer)  
Training and Predicting:
	Splitting data: 
K-fold-like manual implementation
	Tfidf
Models:
LinearSVC, NuSVC, SVC, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
Comparing results of different models
Challenges + Future: small dataset, splitting better clusters, increasing accuracy, trying other tokenizer, small dataset</br>
*Visualization: sklearn and matplotlib to visualize the data for better insights and helping with clustering data
