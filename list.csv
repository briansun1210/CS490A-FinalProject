Elevated first metatarsal, left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux rigidus, left foot.,2.  Elevated first metatarsal, left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Austin/Youngswick bunionectomy with Biopro implant.,2.  Screw fixation, left foot.,HISTORY: , This 51-year-old male presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that he has had degenerative joint disease in his left first MPJ for many years that has been progressively getting worse and more painful over time.  The patient desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 7 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo-type block.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered to the operating table, the stockinet was reflected, and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.,Attention was then directed to the left first metatarsophalangeal joint.  Approximately a 6 cm dorsomedial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, just medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was undermined medially, off of the joint capsule.  A dorsal linear capsular incision was then made.  Care was taken to identify and preserve the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The capsule and periosteum were then reflected off of the head of the first metatarsal as well as the base of the proximal phalanx.  There was noted to be a significant degenerative joint disease.  There was little to no remaining healthy articular cartilage left on the head of the first metatarsal.  There was significant osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally in the first metatarsal head as well as at the base of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the base of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to ensure that the resection was parallel to the nail.  After the bone was removed in toto, the area was inspected and the flexor tendon was noted to be intact.  The sagittal saw was then used to resect the osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally on the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal was then re-modelled and smoothed in a more rounded position with a reciprocating rasp.  The sizers were then inserted for the Biopro implant.  A large was noted to be of the best size.  There was noted to be some hypertrophic bone laterally in the base of the proximal phalanx.  Following inspection, the sagittal saw was used to clean both the medial and lateral sides of the base.  A small bar drill was then used to pre-drill for the Biopro sizer.  The bone was noted to be significantly hardened.  The sizer was placed and a large Biopro was deemed to be the correct size implant.  The sizer was removed and bar drill was then again used to ream the medullary canal.  The hand reamer with a Biopro set was then used to complete the process.  The Biopro implant was then inserted and tamped with a hammer and rubber mallet to ensure tight fit.  There was noted to be distally increased range of motion after insertion of the implant.,Attention was then directed to the first metatarsal.  A long dorsal arm Austin osteotomy was then created.  A second osteotomy was then created just plantar and parallel to the first osteotomy site.  The wedge was then removed in toto.  The area was feathered to ensure high compression of the osteotomy site.  The head was noted to be in a more plantar flexed position.  The capital fragment was then temporarily fixated with two 0.45 K-wires.  A 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion.  A second more proximal 2.7 x 60 mm screw was also inserted in a standard AO fashion.  With both screws, there was noted to be tight compression at the osteotomy sites.,The K-wires were removed and the areas were then smoothed with reciprocating rash.  A screw driver was then used to check and ensure screw tightness.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Subchondral drilling was performed with a 1.5 drill bit.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Closure consisted of capsular closure with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by running subcuticular stitch of #5-0 Vicryl.  Dressings consisted of Steri-Strips, Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  A total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected intraoperatively for further anesthesia.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin ES and instructed to take 1 q.  4-6h. p.o. p.r.n. pain.  The patient was instructed to ice and elevate his left lower extremity as much as possible to help decrease postoperative edema.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his office as directed.","surgery, hallux rigidus, metatarsal, youngswick, bunionectomy, screw fixation, ankle tourniquet, metatarsophalangeal joint, biopro implant, proximal phalanx, foot, austin, anesthesia, osteotomy, screw,"

179, Youngswick osteotomy with internal screw fixation of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint of the right foot., Surgery, Youngswick Osteotomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Youngswick osteotomy with internal screw fixation of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint of the right foot.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux limitus deformity of the right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux limitus deformity of the right foot.,ANESTHESIA:,  Monitored anesthesia care with 15 mL of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 10 mL.,HEMOSTASIS:,  Right ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg for 35 minutes.,MATERIALS USED: , 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and two partially threaded cannulated screws from 3.0 OsteoMed System for internal fixation.,INJECTABLES:  ,Ancef 1 g IV 30 minutes preoperatively.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical site.  The right ankle was then covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  The right foot was prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, all the capsular and periosteal attachments were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right metatarsal.  Once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed, multiple osteophytes were encountered.  Gouty tophi were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint, which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patient.,Using sharp and dull dissection, all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachments were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint was freed from all adhesions.  Using the sagittal saw, all the osteophytes were removed from the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head as well as the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Although some improvement of the range of motion was encountered after the removal of the osteophytes, some tightness and restriction was still present.  The decision was thus made to perform a Youngswick-type osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal.  The osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cuts and a plantar cut in a V-pattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal.  The two dorsal cuts were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The wedge of bone that was formed between the two dorsal cuts was resected and passed off to Pathology for further examination.  The head of the first right metatarsal was then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wires from the OsteoMed System.  The wires were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy.  The wires were also used as guidewires for the insertion of two 16-mm proximally threaded cannulated screws from the OsteoMed System.  The 2 screws were inserted using AO technique.  Upon insertion of the screws, the two wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy on the table was found to be excellent.  The area was copiously flushed with saline and range of motion was reevaluated and was found to be much improved from the preoperative levels without any significant restriction.  The cartilaginous surfaces on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  Steri-Strips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edges.  At this time, the right ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's surgical site was then covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and neurovascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home.  The patient was also given pain medication instructions on how to control her postoperative pain.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.","surgery, hallux limitus deformity, metatarsophalangeal joint, plantar cut, youngswick osteotomy, dorsal cuts, ankle tourniquet, proximal phalanx, anesthesia, tourniquet, youngswick, phalanx, metatarsophalangeal, proximal, metatarsal, dorsal, osteotomy"

", Surgery, Vitrectomy - 3 ,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.

As soon as satisfactory anesthesia and akinesia had been achieved, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manner for sterile ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was inserted.  Three modified sclerotomies were selected at 9, 10, and 1 o'clock.  At the 9 o'clock position, the Accurus infusion line was put in place and tied with a preplaced #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The two superior sites at 10 and 1 were opened up where the operating microscope with the optical illuminating system was brought into position, and closed vitrectomy was begun.  Initially formed core vitrectomy was performed and formed anterior vitreous was removed.  After this was completed, attention was placed in the posterior segment.  Several broad areas of vitreoretinal traction were noted over the posterior pole out of the equator where the previously noted retinal tears were noted.  These were carefully lifted and dissected off the edges of the flap tears and trimmed to the ora serrata.  After all the vitreous had been removed and the membranes released, the retina was completely mobilized.  Total fluid-air exchange was carried out with complete settling of the retina.  Endolaser was applied around the margins of the retinal tears, and altogether several 100 applications were placed in the periphery.  Good reaction was achieved.

A speculum was placed into the vagina.  A single tooth tenaculum was utilized to grasp the anterior lip of the uterine cervix.  The uterus was sounded to 10.5 cm.  A #10 RUMI cannula was utilized and attached for uterine manipulation.  The single-tooth tenaculum and speculum were removed from the vagina.  At this time, the infraumbilical area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and infraumbilical vertical skin incision was made through which a Veress needle was inserted into the abdominal cavity.  Aspiration was negative; therefore the abdomen was insufflated with carbon dioxide.  After adequate insufflation, Veress needle was removed and an 11-mm separator trocar was introduced through the infraumbilical incision into the abdominal cavity.  Through the trocar sheath, the laparoscope was inserted and adequate visualization of the pelvic structures was noted.  At this time, the suprapubic area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine.  A 5-mm skin incision was made and a 5-mm trocar was introduced into the abdominal cavity for instrumentation.  Evaluation of the pelvis revealed the uterus to be slightly enlarged and irregular.  The fallopian tubes have been previously interrupted surgically.  The ovaries appeared normal bilaterally.  The cul-de-sac was clean without evidence of endometriosis, scarring or adhesions.  The ureters were noted to be deep in the pelvis.  At this time, the right cornu was grasped and the right fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected without difficulty.  The remainder of the uterine vessels and anterior and posterior leaves of the broad ligament, as well as the cardinal ligament was coagulated and transected in a serial fashion down to level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  A similar procedure was carried out on the left with the left uterine cornu identified.  The left fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The remainder of the cardinal ligament, uterine vessels, anterior, and posterior sheaths of the broad ligament were coagulated and transected in a serial manner to the level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was then dissected to the midline bilaterally, establishing a bladder flap with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  At this time, attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The laparoscope was removed and attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The RUMI cannula was removed and the anterior and posterior leafs of the cervix were grasped with Lahey tenaculum.  A circumferential injection with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was made at the cervicovaginal portio.  A circumferential incision was then made at the cervicovaginal portio.  The anterior and posterior colpotomies were accomplished with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection without difficulty.  The right uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The left uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The parametrial tissue was then clamped bilaterally, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture bilaterally.  The uterus was then removed and passed off the operative field.  Laparotomy pack was placed into the pelvis.  The pedicles were evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted; therefore, the laparotomy pack was removed.

Live male infant with Apgars of 9 and 9.,2.  Placenta delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient and baby remain in the LDR in stable condition.,SUMMARY: , This is a 36-year-old G1 woman who was pregnant since 40 weeks 6 days when she was admitted for induction of labor for post dates with favorable cervix.  When she was admitted, her cervix was 2.5 cm dilated with 80% effacement.  The baby had a -2 station.  She had no regular contractions.  Fetal heart tones were 120s and reactive.  She was started on Pitocin for labor induction and labored quite rapidly.  She had spontaneous rupture of membranes with a clear fluid.  She had planned on an epidural; however, she had sudden rapid cervical change and was unable to get the epidural.  With the rapid cervical change and descent of fetal head, there were some variable decelerations.  The baby was at a +1 station when the patient began pushing.  I had her push to get the baby to a +2 station.  During pushing, the fetal heart tones were in the 80s and did not recover in between contractions.  Because of this, I recommended a vacuum delivery for the baby.  The patient agreed.,The baby's head was confirmed to be in the right occiput anterior presentation.  The perineum was injected with 1% lidocaine.  The bladder was drained.  The vacuum was placed and the correct placement in front of the posterior fontanelle was confirmed digitally.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was inflated and a gentle downward pressure was used to assist with brining the baby's head to a +3 station.  The contraction ended.  The vacuum was released and the fetal heart tones remained in the, at this time, 90s to 100s.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was reapplied and the baby's head was delivered to a +4 station.  A modified Ritgen maneuver was used to stabilize the fetal head.  The vacuum was deflated and removed.  The baby's head then delivered atraumatically.  There was no nuchal cord.  The baby's anterior shoulder delivered after a less than 30 second delay.  No additional maneuvers were required to deliver the anterior shoulder.  The posterior shoulder and remainder of the body delivered easily.  The baby's mouth and nose were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped x2 and cut.  The infant was handed to the respiratory therapist.,Pitocin was added to the patient's IV fluids.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, was intact and had a three-vessel cord.  A vaginal inspection revealed a third-degree midline laceration as well as a right vaginal side wall laceration.  The right side wall laceration was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion with local anesthesia.  The third-degree laceration was also repaired with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Local anesthesia was used.  The capsule was visible, but did not appear to be injured at all.  It was reinforced with three separate interrupted sutures and then the remainder of the incision was closed with #3-0 Vicryl in the typical fashion.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  She remains in the LDR with the baby.  The baby is vigorous, crying and moving all extremities.  He will go to the new born nursery when ready.  The total time for repair of the laceration was 25 minutes.","surgery, intrauterine pregnancy, non-reassuring fetal heart tones, vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery, vaginal side wall laceration, fetal heart tones, vaginal delivery, vacuum assisted, laceration, intrauterine, tones, contractions, "

208, Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction., Surgery, Upper Endoscopy  ,"PROCEDURE:,  Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , A 92-year-old lady with history of dysphagia on and off for two years.  She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva.  This started almost a day earlier.  She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything.  She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , Informed consent was obtained from patient.  The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed.  Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks.  Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus.  There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus.  This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots.  The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation.  Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.,The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation.  Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net.  Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft.  Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out.  Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully.  The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy.  No active bleeding was seen.  There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach.  As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.,IMPRESSION: , Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.  Treated as described above.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  IV Protonix 40 mg q.12h.  Clear liquid diet for 24 hours.  If the patient is stable, thereafter she may take soft pureed diet only until next endoscopy, which will be scheduled in three to four weeks.  She should take Prevacid SoluTab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge.","surgery, dysphagia, removal of food impaction, distal esophagus, stomach, distal esophageal, esophageal stricture, upper endoscopy, food impaction, endoscopy, aspiration, sedation, bolus, impaction, esophagus, "

The patient was estimated to be approximately 10-1/2 weeks so long in her pregnancy.  She began to have heavy vaginal bleeding and intense lower pelvic cramping.  She was seen in the emergency room where she was found to be hemodynamically stable.  On pelvic exam, her cervix was noted to be 1 to 2 cm dilated and approximately 90% effaced.  There were bulging membranes protruding through the dilated cervix.  These symptoms were consistent with the patient's prior experience of spontaneous miscarriages.  These findings were reviewed with her and options for treatment discussed.  She elected to proceed with an exam under anesthesia with uterine suction curettage.  The risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her and knowing these, she gave informed consent.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where she was placed in the seated position.  A spinal anesthetic was successfully administered.  She was then moved to a dorsal lithotomy position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.  After adequate spinal level was confirmed, a bimanual exam was again performed.  This revealed the uterus to be anteverted to axial and approximately 10 to 11 weeks in size.  The previously noted cervical exam was confirmed.  The weighted vaginal speculum was then inserted and the vaginal vault flooded with povidone solution.  This solution was then removed approximately 10 minutes later with dry sterile gauze sponge.  The anterior cervical lip was then attached with a ring clamp.  The tissue and membranes protruding through the os were then gently grasped with a ring clamp and traction applied.  The tissue dislodged revealing fluid mixed with blood as well as an apparent 10-week fetus.  The placental tissue was then gently tractioned out as well.  A size 9 curved suction curette was then gently inserted through the dilated os and into the endometrial cavity.  With the vacuum tubing applied in rotary motion, a moderate amount of tissue consistent with products of conception was evacuated.  The sharp curette was then utilized to probe the endometrial surface.  A small amount of additional tissue was then felt in the posterior uterine wall.  This was curetted free.  A second pass was then made with a vacuum curette.  Again, the endometrial cavity was probed with a sharp curette and no significant additional tissue was encountered.  A final pass was then made with a suction curette.,The ring clamp was then removed from the anterior cervical lip.  There was only a small amount of bleeding following the curettage.  The weighted speculum was then removed as well.  The bimanual exam was repeated and good involution was noted.  The patient was taken down from the dorsal lithotomy position.  She was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The sponge and instrument count was performed and found to be correct.  The specimen of products of conception and 10-week fetus were submitted to Pathology for further evaluation.  The estimated blood loss for the procedure is less than 10 mL.","surgery, spontaneous, incomplete abortion, uterine suction curettage, fetus, anterior cervical lip, spontaneous incomplete abortion, bimanual exam, ring clamp, suction curettage, uterine, curettage, suction"

The patient was brought to the operative suite where he was placed in supine position and general endotracheal tube intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away and a shoulder roll was placed and a McIvor mouthgag was inserted into the oral cavity.  Correct inspection and palpation did not reveal evidence of a bifid uvula or submucosal clots.  Attention was directed first to the right tonsil in which a curved Allis forceps was applied to the superior pole.  The needle-tip Bovie cautery was used to incise the mucosa of the anterior tonsillar pillar.  Once the tonsillar pillar was identified and the superior pole was released, the curved forceps with a straight Allis forceps and the dissection was carried down inferiorly, dissecting the tonsil free from all fascial attachments.  Once the tonsil was delivered from the oral cavity, hemostasis was obtained within the tonsillar fossa utilizing suction cautery.,Attention was then directed over to the left tonsil in which a similar procedure was performed.  Once all bleeding was controlled, the mucosa of both the hard and soft palate was anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:50000 epinephrine solution.  Now attention was directed to the posterior pillars.  A hemostat was used to clamp the posterior pillar, which was then taken down with Metzenbaum scissors.  The posterior pillar was then approximated to the anterior pillar with the use of #3-0 PDS suture so as to create a box shaped soft palate.  Now, the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and #12 blade scalpel was used to incise the mucosa of the soft palate extending down onto the uvula.  The mucosa was dissected off with the use of Potts scissors.  Now the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and sutured down in place with use of #3-0 PDS suture approximated with deep muscle layers.  Now the mucosa of the soft palate and the uvula were approximated with interrupted #3-0 PDS sutures.  Finally, #4-0 Vicryl sutures were placed intermittently between the PDS to further secure the uvula, which had been reflected onto the soft palate.  A final #3-0 PDS suture was used to further approximate the anterior and posterior tonsil pillars.  Final inspection did not reveal any further bleeding.  The mouth was then irrigated with saline and suctioned.  At this point, the procedure was complete.  He was awakened and taken to recovery room in stable condition.  He will be admitted as an observation patient to the Telemetry Floor for routine postoperative management.  Of note, IV Decadron was administered during the procedure.","surgery, endotracheal, metzenbaum, soft palate, obstructive sleep apnea, tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, obstructive, mucosa, uvula, palate,"

He has had problem with urinary retention and bladder stones in the past.  He will need to have transurethral resection of prostate to alleviate the above-mentioned problems.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Formation of urethral strictures.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was identified, after which he was taken into the operating room.  General LMA anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given prophylactic antibiotic in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then positioned, prepped and draped.  Cystoscopy was then performed by using a #26-French continuous flow resectoscopic sheath and a visual obturator.  The prostatic urethra appeared to be moderately hypertrophied due to the lateral lobes and a large median lobe.  The anterior urethra was normal without strictures or lesions.  The bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula.  There is a very bladder diverticula located in the right posterior bladder wall just proximal to the trigone.  Using the ***** resection apparatus and a right angle resection loop, the prostate was resected initially at the area of the median lobe.  Once the median lobe has completely resected, the left lateral lobe and then the right lateral lobes were taken down.  Once an adequate channel had been achieved, the prostatic specimen was retrieved from the bladder by using an Ellik evacuator.  A 3-mm bar electrode was then introduced into the prostate to achieve perfect hemostasis.  The sheath was then removed under direct vision and a #24-French Foley catheter was then inserted atraumatically with pinkish irrigation fluid obtained.  The patient tolerated the operation well.","surgery, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cystoscopy, foley catheter, turp, transurethral, bladder, bladder diverticula, electrosurgical, obturator, prostate, resectoscopic, transurethral resection, urinary retention, resection of the prostate, transurethral electrosurgical resection, anesthesia, hyperplasia, resection, prostatic"
221, Tube Shunt  - Ahmed valve model S2 implant with pericardial reinforcement - Sample/Template., Surgery, Tube Shunt - Ahmed Valve Implant ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,Open angle glaucoma OX,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Open angle glaucoma OX,PROCEDURE:, Ahmed valve model S2 implant with pericardial reinforcement XXX eye,INDICATIONS: ,This is a XX-year-old (wo)man with glaucoma in the OX eye, uncontrolled by maximum tolerated medical therapy.,PROCEDURE: ,The risks and benefits of glaucoma surgery were discussed at length with the patient including bleeding, infection, reoperation, retinal detachment, diplopia, ptosis, loss of vision, and loss of the eye, corneal hemorrhage, hypotony, elevated pressure, worsening of glaucoma, and corneal edema. Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon was burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure was felt to be adequate. The speculum was removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Then, an eye patch and shield were placed over the eye. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, tube shunt, ahmed valve, healon, maxitrol ointment, ocuflox, open angle, anterior chamber, bleeding, conjunctival peritomy, cornea, corneal edema, corneal hemorrhage, diplopia, elevated pressure, glaucoma, hypotony, infection, loss of the eye, loss of vision, ophthalmic fashion, ptosis, reoperation, retinal detachment, sclera, superotemporal, worsening of glaucoma, ahmed valve model, superotemporal limbus, eye, ahmed, implant, bss, valve, limbus, "

After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, his right arm was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion.  After elevation and exsanguination with an Esmarch, the tourniquet was inflated.  The carpal tunnel was performed first with longitudinal incision in the palm carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  The palmar fascia was divided exposing the transverse carpal ligament, which was incised longitudinally.  A Freer was then inserted beneath the ligament, and dissection was carried out proximally and distally.,After adequate release has been formed, the wound was irrigated and closed with nylon.  The medial approach to the elbow was then performed and the skin was opened and subcutaneous tissues were dissected.  A medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified and protected throughout the case.  The ulnar nerve was noted to be subluxing over the superior aspect of the medial epicondyle and flattened and inflamed.  The ulnar nerve was freed proximally and distally.  The medial intramuscular septum was excised and the flexor carpi ulnaris fascia was divided.  The intraarticular branch and the first branch to the SCU were transected; and then the nerve was transposed, it did not appear to have any significant tension or sharp turns.  The fascial sling was made from the medial epicondyle and sewn to the subcutaneous tissues and the nerve had good translation with flexion and extension of the elbow and not too tight.  The wound was irrigated.  The tourniquet was deflated and the wound had excellent hemostasis.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples.  Prior to the tourniquet being deflated, the subcutaneous dissection was carried out over to the olecranon bursa, where the loose fragments were excised with a rongeurs as well as abrading the ulnar cortex and excision of hypertrophic bursa.  A posterior splint was applied.  Marcaine was injected into the incisions and the splint was reinforced with tape.

Left canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy with ossicular chain reconstruction.,2.  Microdissection.,3.  NIM facial nerve monitoring for three hours.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,FINDINGS:,  There is an extremely large canal cholesteatoma, which eroded most of the posterior and superior canal wall.  There was a significant amount of myringosclerosis and tympanosclerosis.  There is some mild erosion of the lenticular process of the incus.  The facial nerve was normal.  We removed the incus, removed the head of the malleus, and placed a titanium-PORP from the stapes capitulum to a cartilage graft.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed under general anesthetic and intubated without difficulty.  The NIM facial nerve monitoring electrodes were positioned and monitoring was performed throughout the procedure.  There was no abnormal activity during this case.  We inspected the ear canal, identified the huge defect, which was completely filled with cerumen.  Through the ear canal, we removed as much as we could and then infiltrated the canal and postauricular area with 1:100,000 of epinephrine.,We prepped and draped the ear in a sterile fashion.  We reopened the previously used postauricular incision and dissected down the mastoid cortex.  We reflected the soft tissues anteriorly to the level of the ear canal and identified where the ear canal skin entered the defect in the mastoid bone.  A #6 cutting bur was used to drill down the mastoid cortex and identified this cholesteatoma which was then carefully dissected out.  We went all the way to the mastoid antrum.  We finished a complete mastoidectomy with identification of the tegmen, sigmoid sinus.  We removed the lateral aspect of the mastoid tip.  We lowered the facial ridge.  The incudostapedial joint was already membranous in nature, we went ahead and used the joint knife and removed the incus.  We separated the incus from the stapes and then removed it.  We used a malleus head nipper to remove the head of the malleus and then we continued to saucerize the entire mastoid cavity.,There was no cholesteatoma within the middle ear space, but there was roughly 40% surface area perforation.  The remaining portion of the tympanic membrane was extremely calcified and myringosclerotic; this was removed.  There was also a large focus of tympanosclerosis between the stapes crura, which was impinging the ability of the stapes to move.  We carefully dissected this out.  This did seem to improve the mobility of the stapes somewhat.  At this point, there was a near total perforation.  There was only a minimal amount of anterior remnant of the drum left.  We tried to go ahead and harvest the temporalis fascia, but there was really only wisps of this fascia in place.  He had already had a previous tympanoplasty, but even outside the areas where the graft was taken, the temporalis muscle was quite atrophied and lumpy, and I suspect this was due to his chronic disease and long history of corticosteroid usage.  We harvested a few pieces as best as we could.  We went ahead and did a meatoplasty by making a canal incision in the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions.  We excised cartilage posteriorly and inferiorly to enlarge the meatus.  This cartilage was thin and used for cartilage tympanoplasty.  We placed some Gelfoam in the middle ear space and placed the cartilage on the top of it.  We did cut a titanium-PORP of the proper side and placed on top of the stapes capitulum to interface with the cartilage cap.  A few other small pieces of temporalis fascia were used to bulge through the surrounding edges of the cartilage and make sure that it was medial to any remnant of ear canal and tympanic membrane remnants.  We placed a layer of Gelfoam lateral to the graft, closed the postauricular incision in layers and put 2 Merocel packs in the ear.  Glasscock dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  He will be given antibiotics and pain medicines and he will be given instructions to follow up with me in one week.","surgery, cholesteatoma, gelfoam, glasscock dressing, microdissection, nim, canal, canal wall, cerumen, facial nerve, incus, myringosclerosis, ossicular chain reconstruction, titanium-porp, tympanomastoidectomy, tympanosclerosis, facial nerve monitoring, ear canal, cartilage, ear,"

The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.

Upon visualization of the pelvis organs, the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries were all normal.  The probe was withdrawn and replaced with the bipolar cautery instrument.  The right fallopian tube was grasped approximately 1 cm distal to the cornual region of the uterus.  Electrical current was applied to the tube at this point and fulgurated.  The tube was then regrasped just distal to this and refulgurated.  It was then regrasped just distal to the lateral point and refulgurated again.  The same procedure was then carried out on the opposite tube.  The bipolar cautery instrument was withdrawn and replaced with the probe.  The fallopian tubes were again traced to their fimbriated ends to confirm the burn points on the tubes.  The upper abdomen was visualized, and the liver surface was normal.  The gas was allowed to escape from the abdomen, and the instruments were removed.  The skin incisions were repaired.  The instruments were removed from the vagina.,There were no complications to the procedure.  Blood loss was minimal.  The patient went to the postanesthesia recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, tubal fulguration, cohen cannula, laparoscopic, trendelenburg position, veress needle, abdominal cavity, bipolar cautery, dorsal lithotomy, fallopian tubes, fimbriated ends, fulgurated, laparoscope, uterus, distal, trocar, tubesNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.,2.  Enlarged dorsal root ganglia of the left L3 nerve root.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:, Transpedicular decompression of the left L3-L4 with discectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , None.,HISTORY: , This is a 55-year-old female with a four-month history of left thigh pain.  An MRI of the lumbar spine has demonstrated a mass in the left L3 foramen displacing the nerve root, which appears to be a foraminal disc herniation effacing the L3 nerve root.  Upon exploration of the nerve root, it appears that there was a small disc herniation in the foramen, but more impressive was the abnormal size of the dorsal root ganglia that was enlarged more medially than laterally.  There was no erosion into the bone surrounding the area rather in the pedicle above or below or into the vertebral body, so otherwise the surrounding anatomy is normal.  I was prepared to do a discectomy and had not consented the patient for a biopsy of the nerve root.  But because of the sequela of cutting into a nerve root with residual weakness and persistent pain that the patient would suffer, at this point I was not able to perform this biopsy without prior consent from the patient.  So, surgery ended decompressing the L3 foramen and providing a discectomy with idea that we will obtain contrasted MRIs in the near future and I will discuss the findings with the patient and make further recommendations.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital in a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Endotracheal intubation followed.  The patient received the Foley catheter.  She was then placed in a prone position on a Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  Localizing x-rays were obtained at this time and the back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made over the L3-L4 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissues sharply, dissection was then carried out to the left of the midline with lumbodorsal fascia incised and the musculature was elevated in a supraperiosteal fashion from the level of L3.  Retractors were placed into the wound to retract the musculature.  At this point, the pars interarticularis was identified and the facet joint of L2-L3 was identified.  A marker was placed over the pedicle of L3 and confirmed radiographically.  Next, a microscope was brought onto the field.  The remainder of the procedure was noted with microscopic visualization.  A high-speed drill was used to remove the small portions of the lateral aspects of the pars interarticularis.  At this point, soft tissue was removed with a Kerrison rongeur and the nerve root was clearly identified in the foramen.  As the disc space of L3-L4 is identified, there is a small prominence of the disc, but not as impressive as I would expect on the MRI.  A discectomy was performed at this time removing only small portions of the lateral aspect of the disc.  Next, the nerve root was clearly dissected out and visualized, the lateral aspect of the nerve root appears to be normal in structural appearance.  The medial aspect with the axilla of the nerve root appears to be enlarged.  The color of the tissue was consistent with a nerve root tissue.  There was no identifiable plane and this is a gentle enlargement of the nerve root.  There are no circumscribed lesions or masses that can easily be separated from the nerve root.  As I described in the initial paragraph, since I was not prepared to perform a biopsy on the nerve and the patient had not been consented, I do not think it is reasonable to take the patient to this procedure, because she will have persistent weakness and pain in the leg following this procedure.  So, at this point there is no further decompression.  A nerve fork was passed both ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there was no compression for lateral.  The pedicle was palpated inferiorly and medially and there was no compression, as the nerve root can be easily moved medially.  The wound was then irrigated copiously and suctioned dry.  A concoction of Duramorph and ______ was then placed over the nerve root for pain control.  The retractors were removed at this point.  The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissues with #2 Vicryl sutures, and Steri-Strips covering the incision.  The patient transferred to the hospital gurney, extubated by Anesthesia, and subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.","surgery, dorsal root ganglia, nerve root, discectomy, foraminal disc herniation, transpedicular decompression, lateral aspects, disc herniation, nerve, anesthesia, foraminal"

She required intubation and has been ventilator-dependent in the Intensive Care since that time.  The patient developed very high temperatures as well as leukocytosis.  Her lines required being changed.,PROCEDURE:,1.  RIGHT BRACHIAL ARTERIAL LINE:  ,The patient's right arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  There was a good brachial pulse palpated.  The artery was cannulated with the provided needle and the kit.  There was good arterial blood return noted immediately.  On the first stick, the Seldinger wire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the right brachial artery without difficulty.  The needle was removed and a catheter was inserted over the Seldinger wire to cannulate the brachial artery.  The femoral catheter was used in this case secondary to the patient's severe edema and anasarca.  We did not feel that the shorter catheter would provide enough length.  The catheter was connected to the system and flushed without difficulty.  A good waveform was noted.  The catheter was sutured into place with #3-0 silk suture and OpSite dressing was placed over this.,2.  RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN TRIPLE LUMEN CATHETER:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% Xylocaine was used to anesthetize an area just inferior and lateral to the angle of the clavicle.  Using the anesthetic needle, we checked down to the soft tissues anesthetizing, as we proceeded to the angle of the clavicle, this was also anesthetized.  Next, a #18 gauge thin walled needle was used following the same track to the angle of clavicle.  We roughed the needle down off the clavicle and directed it towards the sternal notch.  There was good venous return noted immediately.  The syringe was removed and a Seldinger guidewire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the vein.  The needle was then removed.  A small skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel and the provided dilator was used to dilate the skin, soft tissue and vein.  Next, the triple lumen catheter was inserted over the guidewire without difficulty.  The guidewire was removed.  All the ports aspirated and flushed without difficulty.

General inhalational anesthesia was administered through the patient's existing 4.0 endotracheal tube.  The neck was extended and secured with tape and incision in the midline of the neck approximately 2 fingerbreadths above the sternal notch was outlined.  The incision measured approximately 1 cm and was just below the palpable cricoid cartilage and first tracheal ring.  The incision area was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000.  A #67 blade was used to perform the incision.  Electrocautery was used to remove excess fat tissue to expose the strap muscles.  The strap muscles were grasped and divided in the midline with a cutting electrocautery.  Sharp dissection was used to expose the anterior trachea and cricoid cartilage.  The thyroid isthmus was identified crossing just below the cricoid cartilage.  This was divided in the midline with electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was used to expose adequate cartilaginous rings.  A 4.0 silk was used for stay sutures to the midline of the cricoid.  Additional stay sutures were placed on each side of the third tracheal ring.  Thin DuoDerm was placed around the stoma.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine was also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.

Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was returned to the ICU setting in stable condition where a chest x-ray is pending.","surgery, ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, multiple strokes, thyroid, thyroid isthmusectomy, ventilator dependent, respiratory failure, strap muscles, thyroid gland, endotracheal tube, cricoid cartilage, bovie cautery, tracheostomy, ventilator, strokes, cartilage, tracheal, isthmusectomy"

The patient had subsequently been taken to the operating room by Department of Otolaryngology and a direct laryngoscope was performed.  The patient was noted at that time to have transglottic edema.  Biopsies were taken.  At the time of surgery, it was decided that the patient required a tracheostomy for maintenance of continued ventilation and airway protection.  The patient is currently postop day #6 and appears to be unable to be weaned from ventilator at this time and may require prolonged ventricular support.  A decision was made to perform tracheostomy change.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was seen in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was placed in a supine position.  The neck was then extended.  The sutures that were previously in place in the #6 Shiley with proximal extension were removed.  The patient was preoxygenated to 100%.  After several minutes, the patient was noted to have a pulse oximetry of 100%.  The IV tubing that was supporting the patient's trache was then cut.  The tracheostomy tube was then suctioned.,The inner cannula was then removed from the tracheostomy and a nasogastric tube was placed down the lumen of the tracheostomy tube as a guidewire.  The tracheostomy tube was then removed over the nasogastric tube and the operative field was suctioned.  With the guidewire in place and with adequate visualization, a new #6 Shiley with proximal extension was then passed over the nasogastric tube guidewire and carefully inserted into the trachea.  The guidewire was then removed and the inner cannula was then placed into the tracheostomy.  The patient was then reconnected to the ventilator and was noted to have normal tidal volumes.  The patient had a tidal volume of 500 and was returning 500 cc to 510 cc.  The patient continued to saturate well with saturations 99%.  The patient appeared comfortable and her vital signs were stable.  A soft trache collar was then connected to the trachesotomy.  A drain sponge was then inserted underneath the new trache site.  The patient was observed for several minutes and was found to be in no distress and continued to maintain adequate saturations and continued to return normal tidal volumes.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well.  0.25% acetic acid soaks were ordered to the drain sponge every shift.","surgery, shiley, proximal extension, ventilator-dependent, respiratory failure, laryngeal edema, tracheostomy, cannula, respiratory, laryngeal, nasogastric, edema, ventilator"

However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.","surgery, airway, laryngology, shiley, alteration of voice, bronchi, bronchoscopy, cannula, cartilage, cricoid, flexible, foreign body, mainstem, obstruction, perichondrium, stenosis, stent, subglottic, swallowing, trachea, tracheal, tracheal stenosis, tracheostomy, shiley single cannula tracheostomy, shiley single cannula, single cannula tracheostomy, thyroid isthmus, stent material, tracheostomy tube, tube, thyroid, "

The patient subsequently then had a CT scan which demonstrated a very large thyroid gland, especially on the left side with substernal extension down to the level of the aortic arch.  The patient was then immediately set up for surgery.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the patient, a written consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  The patient was then placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient then had a shoulder roll placed.  After this, the patient then had the area marked initially.  The preoperative setting was then localized with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 10 cc total.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #15 Bard-Parker was then utilized to make a skin incision horizontally, approximately 5 cm on either side from midline.  After this, a blunt dissection was then utilized to dissect the subcutaneous fat from the platysmal muscle.  There appeared to be a natural dehiscence of the platysma in the midline.  A sub-platysmal dissection was then performed in the superior, inferior, and lateral directions with the help of a bear claw, Metzenbaum scissors and DeBakey forceps.  Any bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization.  After this, the two anterior large jugular veins were noted and resected laterally.  The patient's trachea appeared to be slightly deviated to the right with identification finally of the midline raphe, off midline to the right.  This was grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps and dissected with monopolar cauterization and dissected with a Metzenbaum scissors.  After this was dissected, the sternohyoid muscles were resected laterally and separated from the sternothyroid muscles.  The sternothyroid muscles were then bluntly freed and dissected from the right thyroid gland.  After this, attention was then drawn to the left gland, where the sternothyroid muscle was dissected bluntly on this side utilizing finger dissection and Kitners.  The left thyroid gland was freed initially superiorly and worked inferiorly and laterally until the gland was pulled from the substernal region by blunt dissection and reflected and pulled anteriorly.  After this, the superior and inferior parathyroid glands were noted.  The dissection was carried very close to the thyroid gland to try to select these parathyroids posteriorly.  After this, the superior pole was then identified and the superior laryngeal artery and vein were cross clamped and tied with __________ undyed Vicryl tie.  The superior pole was finally freed and a small little feeding branched vessels from this area were cauterized with the bipolar cautery and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  After this, the thyroid gland was further freed down to the level of the Berry's ligament inferiorly and the dissection was carried once again more superiorly.  The fine stats were then utilized to dissect along the superior aspect of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side with freeing of the connective Berry's ligament tissue from the gland with the bipolar cauterization and the fine stat.  Finally, attention was then drawn back to the patient's right side where the gland was rotated more anteriorly with fine dissection utilizing a fine stat to reflect the superior and inferior parathyroid glands laterally and posteriorly.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve on this side was identified and further dissection was carried superiorly and anteriorly through this nerve to finally free the right side of the gland to Berry's ligament.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid arteries were cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties and also bipolared with the bipolar cauterization bilaterally.  The Berry's ligament was then finally freed and the gland was then passed to scrub tech and passed off the field to Pathology.  The neck was then thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  After this, Surgicel was then placed in the bilateral neck regions and a #10 Jackson-Pratt drain was then placed within the left neck region with some extension over to the right neck region.  This was brought out through the inferior skin incision and secured to the skin with a #2-0 nylon suture.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with a running #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by reapproximation of the platysma and subcutaneous tissue with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The skin was then reapproximated with a #5-0 Prolene subcuticular along with a #6-0 fast over the top.  After this, Mastisol Steri-Strips and Bacitracin along with a sterile dressing and a __________ dressing were then placed.  The patient intraoperatively did have approximately 50 cc of bloody drainage from this area within the JP drain.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia, extubated in the operating room and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.

The patient was placed on the operative table in supine position.  After this, the patient was placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient was then placed upon a shoulder roll.  After this, the skin incision was marked approximately two fingerbreadths above the sternal notch.  It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:1000 approximately 7 cc total.,After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a #10 blade was then utilized to make a skin incision.  The subcutaneous tissue was then bluntly dissected utilizing a Ray-Tec sponge and a bear claw was then utilized to retract the upper incisional skin with counter retraction performed to allow a subplatysmal plane of skin flaps to be performed in superior and inferolateral directions.  After this, the midline was then identified and grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps.  The raphe was noted and Bovie cauterization was utilized to cut down into this region.  The fine stats were utilized to further open this area with exposure and bisection of the sternothyroid muscle.  It was separated on the left side from the patient's sternothyroid muscle.  After this, the sternothyroid muscle was identified, grasped with the DeBakey forceps and infiltrated initially through its fascial plane with the Metzenbaum scissors.  Blunt dissection was then utilized to free the sternothyroid muscle from the thyroid gland in superior and inferior directions and laterally with the help of Kitners.  After this, the plane was rotated more anteriorly with the superior and inferior parathyroid glands identified.  The fat cap was noted to be attached on the superior parathyroid to the posterior aspect of the thyroid itself.  It was freed from the thyroid gland and reflected laterally and posteriorly.  The inferior parathyroid gland actually appeared to be attached also to the inferior aspect of the thyroid itself and was reflected laterally.  After this, the patient's thyroid gland was palpated noting a thyroid nodule in the posterior inferior aspect along with the calcification laterally.  The nodule appeared to be sort of rubbery in consistency and approximately 1 cm diameter.  As the gland was rotated more anteriorly, the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side was identified and further dissection along Berry's ligament on the medial aspect was performed.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid artery were both cauterized with a bipolar cautery and bisected.  After this, the gland was easily rotated anteriorly with further dissection carried up to the superior pole.  The superior pole was exposed with the help of a Richardson and Army-Navy retractors with cross-clamping and tying of the superior laryngeal artery and vein.  Further, the small bleeding vessels were identified and bipolared, and cut with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The superior pole was finally freed and the gland was rotated more anteriorly onto the anterior aspect of the trachea.  Berry's ligament was finally freed and the gland was cross-clamped on the opposing thyroid isthmus with a mosquito.  After this, the gland was cut with a Metzenbaum scissors and tied with a #3-0 undyed Vicryl tie.  The defect on the neck now was thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  Surgicel was then cut in small strips and three replaced in the lateral part of the neck.,The opposing side of the thyroid gland on the right was palpated with no noticeable nodules or masses.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl on a SH, followed by reapproximation of the subcutaneous tissue with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by reapproximation of the skin by running subcuticular #5-0 Prolene and a #6-0 fast absorbing gut.

A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.", Surgery, Total Knee Replacement - 1 ,"PROCEDURES: , Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh.  Sterile prepping and draping proceeded.  The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.  A midline incision was made, centered over the patella.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally.  Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues.  The ACL and PCL were released.  The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed.  These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia.  An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, proximal medial tibia, total knee replacement, parapatellar arthrotomy, subcutaneous tissues, tibial plateau, incision, cutting, patella, femur, femoral, component, knee,"

In the preoperative area, the patient received pilocarpine drops.  The patient received IV propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were given.  The operative eye then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lids, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A screw type speculum was inserted to maintain patency of lids.  A 6-0 Vicryl suture was placed through the superior cornea, and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior conjunctiva.  A peritomy was performed approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to the limbus and this flap was dissected forward to the cornea.  All Tenons were removed from the overlying sclera and the area was treated with wet-field cautery to achieve hemostasis.  A 2 mm x 3 mm scleral flap was then outlined with a Micro-Sharp blade.  This was approximately one-half scleral depth in thickness.  A crescent blade was then used to dissect forward the clear cornea.  Hemostasis was again achieved with wet-field cautery.  A Weck-Cel sponge tip soaked in mitomycin was then placed under the conjunctival and tenon flap and left there for two minutes.  The site was then profusely irrigated with balanced salt solution.  A paracentesis wound was made temporarily and then the Micro-Sharp blade was used to enter the anterior chamber at the anterior most margin of the trabeculectomy bed.  A Kelly-Descemet punch was then inserted, and a trabeculectomy was performed.  Iris was withdrawn through the trabeculectomy site and a peripheral iridectomy was performed using Vannas scissors and 0.12 forceps.  The iris was then repositioned into the eye and the anterior chamber was inflated with BSS.  The scleral flap was sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures with knots trimmed, rotated, and buried.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture on a BV needle.  BSS was irrigated in the anterior chamber and the blood was noted to elevate nicely without leakage.  Antibiotic and steroid drops were placed in the eye as was homatropine 5%.  The antibiotic consisted of Vigamox and the steroid was Econopred Plus.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after the drape was removed.

The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.,A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component.,At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially.,A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert.,This gave good stability and a full range of motion.,The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component was drilled for.,A further trial reduction was done and two liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement was hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill holes were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone was somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate was secured and the patella was inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement was removed. At this point the tibial baseplate was locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly.,The knee was extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minutes until the cement was cured. Further extraneous cement was removed. The pneumatic tourniquet was released, hemostasis was obtained with electrocoagulation.,Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples. A sterile, bulky compression dressing was placed. The patient was stable on operative release.","surgery, osteoarthritis, arthroplasty, knee, patella, retinacular parapatellar, total knee arthroplasty, total knee, knee arthroplasty, baseplate, femoral, tibia,"
252," Total left knee replacement.  Degenerative arthritis of the left knee.  Degenerative ware of three compartments of the trochlea, the medial, as well as the lateral femoral condyles as well was the plateau.  ", Surgery, Total Knee Replacement ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,Degenerative arthritis of the left knee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Degenerative arthritis of the left knee.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Total left knee replacement on 08/19/03.  The patient also underwent a bilateral right total knee replacement in the same sitting and that will be dictated by Dr. X.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 76 minutes.,BLOOD LOSS: , 150 cc.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,IMPLANT USED FOR PROCEDURE:,  NexGen size F femur on the left with #8 size peg tibial tray, a #12 mm polyethylene insert and this a cruciate retaining component.  The patella on the left was not resurfaced.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Degenerative ware of three compartments of the trochlea, the medial, as well as the lateral femoral condyles as well was the plateau.  The surface of the patella was with a minimal ware and minimal osteophytes and we decided not to resurface the patellar component.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 69-year-old male with complaints of bilateral knee pain for several years and increased intensity in the past several months where it has affected his activities of daily living.  He attempted conservative treatment, which includes anti-inflammatory medications as well as cortisone and Synvisc.  This has only provided him with temporary relief.  It is for that reason, he is elected to undergo the above-named procedure.,All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient, which include, but are not limited to infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain.  He has agreed to undergo this procedure and a consent was obtained preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to operating room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/19/03 and was placed supine on the operating room table.  At this time, a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the left extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg.  At this time, a standard midline incision was made towards the total knee.  We did discuss preoperatively for a possible unicompartmental knee replacement for this patient, but he did have radiographic evidence of chondrocalcinosis of the lateral meniscus.  We did start off with a small midline skin incision in case we were going to do a unicompartmental.  Once we exposed the medial parapatellar mini-arthrotomy and visualized the lateral femoral condyle, we decided that this patient would not be an optimal candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement.  It is for this reason that we extended the incision and underwent with the total knee replacement.  Once the full medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed with the subperiosteal dissection of the proximal tibia in order to evert the patella.  Once the patella was everted, we then used a drill to cannulate the distal femoral canal in order to place the intramedullary guide.  A Charnley awl was then used to remove all the intramedullary contents and they were removed from the knee.  At this time, a femoral sizer was then placed with reference to the posterior condyles and we measured a size F. Once this was performed, three degrees of external rotation was then drilled into the condyle in alignment with the epicondyles of the femur.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was then inserted and placed in three degrees of external rotation.  Our anterior cutting guide was then placed and an anterior cut was performed with careful protection of the soft tissues.  Next, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  This was pinned to the distal femur and with careful protection of the collateral ligaments, a distal femoral cut was performed.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was removed and a final cutting block was placed.  This was placed in the center on the distal femur with 1 mm to 2 mm laterally translated for better patellar tracking.  At this time, the block was pinned and screwed in place with spring pins with careful protection of the soft tissues.  An oscillating saw was then used to resect the posterior and anterior cutting blocks with anterior and posterior chamfer as well as the notch cut.  Peg holes were then drilled.,The block was then removed and an osteotome was then used to remove all the bony cut pieces.  At this time with a better exposure of the proximal tibia, we placed external tibial guide.  This was placed with longitudinal axis of the tibia and carefully positioned in order to obtain an optimal cut for the proximal tibia.  At this time with careful soft tissue retraction and protection, an oscillating saw was used to make a proximal tibial osteotomy.  Prior to the osteotomy, the cut was checked with a depth gauge in order to assure appropriate bony resection.  At this time, a _blunt Kocher and Bovie cautery were used to remove the proximal tibial cut, which had soft tissue attachments.  Once this was removed, we then implanted our trial components of size F to the femur and a size 8 mm tibial tray with 12 mm plastic articulating surface.  The knee was taken through range of motion and revealed excellent femorotibial articulation.  The patella did tend to sublux somewhat laterally with extremes of flexion and it was for this reason, we performed a minimal small incision lateral retinacular release.  Distal lateral patella was tracked more uniformly within the patellar groove of the prosthesis.  At this time, an intraoperative x-ray was performed, which revealed excellent alignment with no varus angulation especially of the whole femur and tibial alignment and tibial cut.  At this time, the prosthesis was removed.  A McGill retractor was then reinserted and replaced peg tibial tray in order to peg the proximal tibia.  Once the drill holes were performed, we then copiously irrigated the wound and then suctioned it dry to get ready and prepped for cementation of the drilled components.  At this time, polymethyl methacrylate cement was then mixed.  The cement was placed on the tibial surface as well as the underneath surface of the component.  The component was then placed and impacted with excess cement removed.  In a similar fashion, the femoral component was also placed.  A 12 mm plastic tray was then placed and the leg held in full extension and compression in order to obtain adequate bony cement content.  Once the cement was fully hardened, the knee was flexed and a small osteotome was used to remove any extruding cement from around the prosthesis of the bone.  Once this was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound and the wound was then suctioned dry.  The knee was again taken through range of motion with a 12 mm plastic as well as #14.  The #14 appeared to be a bit too tight especially in extremes of flexion.  We decided to go with a #12 mm polyethylene tray.  At this time, this was placed to the tibial articulation and then left in place.  This was rechecked with careful attention to detail with checking no soft tissue interpositioned between the polyethylene tray and the metal tray of the tibia.  The knee was again taken through range of motion and revealed excellent tracking of the patella with good femur and tibial contact.  A drain was placed and cut to length.,At this time, the knee was irrigated and copiously suction dried.  #1-0 Ethibond suture was then used to approximate the medial parapatellar arthrotomy in figure-of-eight fashion.  A tight capsular closure was performed.  This was reinforced with a #1-0 running Vicryl suture.  At this time, the knee was again taken through range of motion to assure tight capsular closure.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the superficial wound.  #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the wound with figure-of-eight inverted suture.  The skin was then approximated with staples.  The leg was then cleansed.  Sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, and Kerlix roll were then applied.  At this time, the patient was extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good for this patient.","surgery, degenerative arthritis, nexgen, polyethylene, cruciate, total knee replacement, proximal tibia, knee replacement, femoral, cutting, tibial, knee, arthritis, femur, cementation, "

4085, A woman with a remote history of ileojejunal bypass followed by gastric banding to facilitate weight loss. , Consult - History and Phy., Wound Care Consult ,"TYPE OF CONSULTATION:,  Wound care consult.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for prior ileojejunal bypass for weight loss (1980) and then subsequent gastric banding (2002 Dr. X) who was transferred to this facility following a complicated surgical and postoperative course after takedown of the prior gastroplasty and bypass (07/08/2008, Dr. Y).  The patient has been followed by Cardiothoracic Surgery (Dr. Z) as an outpatient.  She had a history of daily postprandial vomiting, regurgitation, and heartburn.  She underwent a preop assessment of her GERD and postprandial vomiting including nuclear gastric emptying studies, which showed increased esophageal retention with normal gastric emptying.  Preoperative barium swallow demonstrated moderated esophageal dysmotility with incomplete emptying and a small hiatal hernia.  It was recommended that she undergo an exploratory laparotomy and possible redo fundoplication and possible gastrectomy.  She had already undergone multiple EGDs with dilatations without success.  She continued to have abdominal discomfort.,On 07/07/2008, she was admitted to hospital.  She underwent an exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and Dor fundoplication, repair of hiatal hernia, small bowel resection x2 with primary anastomosis, extensive lysis of adhesions, insertion of a red-rubber J tube, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  She also had her ileojejunal bypass reversed.  Postoperatively, she was able to be extubated.  She was started on TPN, given the risk of not being able to tolerate enteral nutrition.  Her operative note confirmed that the stomach pouch was enlarged with outlet obstruction where the band was.  There was 2 hours of extensive lysis of adhesions.  It took 2 hours to identify the colon.  A defect was repaired in the transverse colon.  The bypass segment of the anastomosis was seen between the proximal jejunum and the distal ileum, which was divided and the proximal jejunum was reconnected to the atretic blind limb of the small bowel.  A red feeding tube was placed proximal to the anastomosis then tended to cross the anastomosis into the distal atretic small bowel for enteral feeds.  The hiatal hernia was repaired as noted.  The obstructed proximal gastric segment was resected.  An anastomosis was made between the proximal intestine and the stomach and distal esophagus with Dor fundoplication.  Omentectomy was performed due to devascularization.  The wound was able to be closed with staples.,Postoperatively, the patient was started on IV antibiotics.  She was able to be extubated.  However, on 07/14/2008, she coded with shortness of breath and chest pain.  She had respiratory failure, required endotracheal intubation and ICU management.  CT scan of the abdomen and the pelvis confirmed that she had an anastomotic leak.  Sputum cultures were positive ESBL Klebsiella.  Blood cultures were negative.  She was managed closely for sepsis with an elevated white cell count.  She was also febrile.  Her chest x-ray also showed left lower lobe consolidation.  She had scattered contrast material in the anterior abdomen and left upper quadrant due to the anastomotic leak.  Her antibiotics were adjusted.  Of note, the patient did have a JP drain placed out to the surface during her initial surgery.  Followup CT scan on 07/16/2008 confirmed the anastomosis as the likely site of a fistula, as there was continued extraluminal enteric contrast seen within anterior abdomen just beneath the peritoneum as well as the left upper quadrant adjacent to the spleen.  No enteric contrast was seen surrounding the patient's known GE junction leak.  A JP drain was noted at the posterior aspect of the fundoplication.  There was only a small amount of pelvic fluid.  Follow up scan again on 07/25/2008 showed no abscess formation.  On 08/05/2008, she did underwent an advancement of the #14 French red-rubber catheter feeding tube distal to the dehiscence of fistula into the distal small bowel.  At the beginning of the procedure, the catheter did appear to traverse through an anastomotic suture line in the wound dehiscence.  At some point during her course, the patient did undergo a second operative procedure, but I do not have any operative note at this time.  She subsequently was left with a large open abdominal defect, which was being managed by the wound care nurses, which at the time of her transfer to this facility was being managed with a ""wound manager system."" to low-continuous wall suction.  She was also transferred on tube feedings via the red rubber catheter 20 mL per hour.  She is only to have her tube feeds increased by 10 mL a week to ensure tolerance.  During her course, she was started on TPN.  She was transferred on TPN here.,At the time of her transfer, the patient was no longer on IV antibiotics.  She is on Fragmin for DVT prophylaxis.  During her course, she did have to undergo a tracheostomy.  This has subsequently been removed and this site is healing.  The tracheostomy was removed on 08/06/2008, I believe.  At the time of her tracheostomy (on 07/22/2008), the patient also underwent a flexible bronchoscopy, which showed some secretions in the left airway (right was clear), which did not appear to be purulent.  Of note also, pathology of her partial stomach resection showed Helicobacter pylori gastritis.  There were no other significant abnormalities noted in the small intestine or omentum.  On 08/11/2008, the patient was transferred to HealthSouth Monroeville LTAC for continued medical management, wound care, and rehab therapies.1,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,History of diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - on Lyrica and Cymbalta preoperatively.

History of MRSA in knees (previous surgery).,ALLERGIES:,  MULTIPLE INCLUDING TETRACYCLINE, ERYTHROMYCIN, MORPHINE, SULFA DRUGS, BETADINE, ADHESIVE TAPES, AND BANDAGE.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Prior to admission, the patient lived alone in a one storied dwelling.  She does have some equipment at home including a powered wheelchair, which she uses for longer distance.  She does have some ambulatory devices also.  She used to smoke, but quit about 10 years ago.  She smoked 1 to 2 packs a day from age 18 to 54.  She does not smoke.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Remarkable for cardiac disease with early death of her father at age 43 and mother had Alzheimer.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , According to her notes, the patient's weight 07/10/2008 was 256 pounds.  She has a BMI of 44 indicating morbid obesity.  She had had a significant weight loss in the 6 months prior to this of 7%.  As noted, she is on TPN and enteral feeds.  Her prealbumin level noted on 07/10/2008 was low at 7.  Prior to admission, the patient ate a regular diet, but had most likely weight loss and inadequate intake due to her chronic postprandial vomiting and esophageal dysmotility.  She is currently NPO with NG to suction.  The patient has no complaints of abdominal pain or discomfort at the time of this exam.  She was awake and alert.  MRSA screen on 07/14/2008 was negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  The patient is a morbidly obese woman, who is in no acute distress at the time of this exam.  She is lying comfortably on a low air loss mattress.  She had just been assisted with cleaning up and had no complaints of pain or discomfort.,Vital Signs:  Temperature is 98.9, pulse is 95, blood pressure is 123/69, and weight is 239 pounds.,HEENT:  Normocephalic/atraumatic.  Extraocular muscles intact.  Her mentation is good.,Neck:  Stout.  There is good range of motion.,Cor:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs appreciated.,Lungs:  Fairly clear anteriorly.,Abdomen:  Remarkable for a large open abdominal wound with a collection system in place covering the entire wound in midline.  There is a JP drain and a red rubber catheter present.  At present, the wound manager system is somewhat collapsed.  She had just been on her side.  It is connected to low continuous wall suction and removing fluid.,Musculoskeletal:  There is PICC line present in the right upper extremity.  No significant pedal edema.  Bilateral knee scars from prior surgeries.,Skin:  Reported intact at this time (not seen by me).,Neurological:  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact.  She is able to answer questions appropriately.  She is able to raise both arms over head.  She is able to raise her legs, but does need assistance.  She has fair bed mobility and requires much assistance for any turning.  Gait and transfers not tested.,SUMMARY: , In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a remote history of ileojejunal bypass followed by gastric banding to facilitate weight loss.  However, she subsequently developed reflux associated with postprandial vomiting, which was found to be secondary to esophageal retention.  On 07/08/2008, she underwent exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and Dor fundoplication, hiatal hernia repair, small bowel resection, and lysis of adhesions.  She has had a fairly rocky postoperative course and has subsequently underwent some type of re-exploration after she was noted to have enteric contents draining from her JP drain with confirmed anastomotic leak.  She has undergone placement on an NG tube.  At present, she is on enteral feeds as well as TPN.  During all these, she also coded and had respiratory failure, requiring vent management, but this has improved.  Her trach has been removed and this site is healing.  From the wound standpoint, her largest problem at this point is the abdominal wound, which is open.  A wound manager system is currently in place, which is connected to low intermittent wall suction for drainage of the enteral contents still present. At present, the drainage is quite yellow in appearance.  She has no significant complaints of pain at this time.  At some point in her notes, there was mention of a negative pressure wound therapy being used to this wound, but this cannot be confirmed at this time.  I will plan to contact Dr. Z's office to see whether or not they wanted to resume a wound VAC system to this wound.  For now, we will continue with wound manager system.  We will need to keep track of in's and out's of drainage from this site.  Her fluid status will need to be monitored.  In an attempt to get her mobilized, we will need extra care to be sure that this wound dressing/management system stays in place.  She is eager and motivated to get mobilized.  We will plan to ask Plastic (Dr. A) to be involved in following this wound also.  Again, I will plan to call the surgeon's office for further directions.  She is to follow up with Dr. Z in 2 weeks.,Later in afternoon, I was able to reach Dr. Z's office.  I was called back by one of his nurses, who advised me that a wound VAC (negative pressure wound therapy) was not to be used on this wound.  They are using the wound manager system.  She did report that the confusion came about with the inability during her discharge summary dictation that she was only able to cite a ""wound VAC"" when describing the system that was in place on the patient.  She was using a formatted discharge summary program.  At present, the patient has had some leakage from the system.  According to my discussion with our wound care coordinator at this time, this system has been removed, with leakage repaired, and replaced with another wound manager system with suctioning continuing.  Pictures were also taken of the wound bed.  There were several staples apparently in place.  I was not present at the time that this system had to be changed.",

There is an afferent pupillary defect on the right.  On examination, there is a right hypertropia.  There is dense anterior chamber inflammation on the right eye with a stagnant aqueous.  There is either neovascularization on the iris or reactive iris vessels, it is difficult to discern.  This seems to be complete iris synechia to the anterior lens capsule.  There is a posterior chamber intraocular lens with an inflammatory debris on the anterior surface.  The anterior chamber appears narrow.  On the left, there is also dense inflammation at 4+ cell.  There is 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  Dilated fundus examination cannot be performed on the right secondary to intense inflammation.  On the left, there is no evidence of active posterior uveitis.  There is some inferior vitreous debris.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,  Chronic bilateral recurrent nongranulomatous diffuse uveitis.  Currently, there is very severe right eye inflammation and severe left eye.  I discussed at length with the patient that this will likely take an oral steroid to quite her down.  Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroids at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte as well as atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.  I am sending a copy of this dictation to her primary care doctor, she said she has had a negative HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, and ANA in the past.  At this stage, to be thorough I would ask Dr. X to assist us in repeating her chest x-ray, PPD if not current, and an RPR.  Additionally, in anticipation of need for methotrexate, it would be helpful to have a full liver function profile as well as hepatitis B and hepatitis C.","consult - history and phy., iritis, nongranulomatous, uveitis, eye inflammation, photophobia, recurrent nongranulomatous anterior iritis, headache and photophobia, anterior chamber, anterior, chamber, inflammation, "

The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis., Consult - History and Phy., Thyroid Mass Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 16-year-old young lady, who was referred from the Pediatric Endocrinology Department by Dr. X for evaluation and surgical recommendations regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid, which has now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy.  The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004.  An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed.  When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there.  The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.  The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction.  She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism.  There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family.  She has no notable discomfort with this lesion.  There have been no skin changes.  Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Essentially unremarkable.  The patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses.  She has had no prior surgical procedures.,IMMUNIZATIONS: , Current and up to date.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,Currently taking no routine medications.

This was done in Tijuana.  His mom is from central portion of Mexico.  There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a junior at Hoover High School.  She lives with her mom in Fresno.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress.  She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.,HEENT:  The head and neck examination is most significant.  There is mild amount of facial acne.  The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.,NECK:  There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus.  A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid.  This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine.  There are some shotty adenopathy in the area.  No supraclavicular nodes were noted.,CHEST:  Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal.  There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.,ABDOMEN:  Benign.,EXTREMITIES:  Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.,GENITOURINARY:  External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.  This is same as too for her rectal examination.,SKIN:  There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.,NEUROLOGIC:  Normal and no focal deficits.  Her voice is strong and clear.  There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range.  T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal.  Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative.  There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this.  A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed.  There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease.  I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease.  During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy.  We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation.  We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well.  I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them.  I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit.  This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy.  The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case.  I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity.  All of the family's questions have been answered.  This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family.  I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done.  We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.",
4105, Patient referred for evaluation of tracheostomy tube placement and treatment recommendations., Consult - History and Phy., Tracheostomy Tube Consult ,"HISTORY:  ,I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient today, referred for evaluation of tracheostomy tube placement and treatment recommendations.  As you are well aware, he is a pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who unfortunately is suffering from end-stage COPD, who required tracheostomy tube placement about three months ago when being treated for acute exacerbation of COPD and having difficulty coming off ventilatory support.  He now resides in an extended care facility with a capped tracheostomy tube, and he unfortunately states he has had not had to use the tracheostomy tube since his discharge and admission to the extended care facility.  He requires constant oxygen administration and has been having no problems with shortness of breath, worsening, requiring opening the tracheostomy tube site.  He states there has been some tenderness associated with the tracheostomy tube and difficulty with swallowing and he wishes to have it removed.  Apparently there is no history of any airway issues while sleeping or need for uncapping the tube and essentially the tube has just remained present for months capped in his neck.  No history of any previous tracheostomy tube insertion.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , COPD, history of hypercarbic hypoxemia, history of coronary artery disease, history of previous myocardial infarction, and history of liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, hernia repair, and tracheostomy.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Strong for heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular accident.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Prevacid, folic acid, aspirin, morphine sulfate, Pulmicort, Risperdal, Colace, clonazepam, Lotrisone, Roxanol, Ambien, Zolpidem tartrate, simethicone, Robitussin, and prednisone.,ALLERGIES: , Nitroglycerin.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient has a 25-year-smoking history, which I believe is quite heavy and he has a significant alcohol use in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 64, blood pressure is 110/78, pulse 96, and temperature is 98.6.,GENERAL:  The patient was examined in his wheelchair, resting comfortably, in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.,EARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.,NOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.

History of coronary artery disease.,4.  History of myocardial infarction.,5.  History of cirrhosis of liver.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I discussed with the patient in detail after fiberoptic laryngoscopy and limited bronchoscopy was performed in the office whether or not to pull out the tracheostomy tube.  His vocal cords moved well, and I do not see any signs of granuloma or airway obstruction either in the supraglottic or subglottic region, and I felt he would tolerate the tube being removed with close monitoring by nursing at his extended care facility.  I did impress the fact that I believe he probably will have other events requiring airway support, which could include intubation, and if the intubation is prolonged a tracheostomy may be needed.  Creation of a long-term tracheostoma may be beneficial whereas the patient would not need such a long tracheostomy tube, and I informed the patient there are other options other than the tube he has at the present time.  The patient still wished to have the tube removed and he is aware he may need to have it replaced or he may have trouble with the area healing or scarring or he could end up having an emergent airway situation with the tube gone, but wishes to have it removed, and I did remove it today.  Dressing was applied and we will see him back next week to make sure everything is healing properly.",

He reports he experienced a single episode of his vision decreasing ""like it was compressed from the top down with a black sheet coming down"".  The episode lasted approximately five minutes and occurred three weeks ago while he was driving a car.  He was able to pull the car over to the side of the road safely.  During the episode, he felt nauseated and possibly lightheaded.  His wife was present and noted that he looked extremely pale and ashen during the episode.  He went to see the Clinic at that time and received a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, echocardiogram, and neurological evaluation, all of which were unremarkable.  It was suggested at that time that he get a CT angiogram since he cannot have an MRI due to his pacemaker.  He has had no further similar events.  He denies any lesions or other visual change, focal weakness or sensory change, headaches, gait change or other neurological problem.,He also reports that he has been diagnosed with lumbar stenosis based on some mild difficulty arising from a chair for which an outside physician ordered a CT of his L-spine that reportedly showed lumbar stenosis.  The question has arisen as to whether he should have a CT myelogram to further evaluate this process.  He has no back pain or pain of any type, he denies bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness.  He is extremely active and plays tennis at least three times a week.  He denies recent episodes of unexpected falls.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He only endorses hypothyroidism, the episode of visual loss described above and joint pain.

TIA.  The character of his brief episode of visual loss is concerning for compromise of the posterior circulation.  Differential diagnoses include hypoperfusion, stenosis, and dissection.  He is to get a CT angiogram to evaluate the integrity of the cerebrovascular system.  He has recently been started on Paxil by his primary care physician and this should be continued.  Other risk factors need to be evaluated; however, we will wait for the results to be sent from the outside hospital so that we do not have to repeat his prior workup.  The patient and his wife assure me that the workup was complete and that nothing was found at that time.,2.  Lumbar stenosis.  His symptoms are very mild and consist mainly of some mild proximal upper extremity weakness and very mild gait instability.  In the absence of motor stabilizing symptoms, the patient is not interested in surgical intervention at this time.

In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy.  In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation.  I will be happy to follow the patient with you.","consult - history and phy., atrial fibrillation, carotid bruit, slurred speech, numbness, calcified mass lesion, neurological examination, tias, carotid, benign,"

When sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis.  He also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point.  Gait was not tested today.,IMPRESSION: , This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence.  I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance.  The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  He may benefit from Botox.,In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.  They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call EMS at any point during that time.  Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them.  Other medication options would include Keppra, Zonegran or Lamictal.,FOLLOWUP: , Followup has already been scheduled with Dr. Y in February and they will continue to keep that date for followup.",

The patient is a product of a term pregnancy that was uncomplicated and no perinatal issues are raised.  Parents; however, did note the patient to be quite dusky since the time of her birth; however, were reassured by the pediatrician that this was normal.  The patient demonstrates good interval weight gain and only today presented to an outside hospital with significant duskiness, some irritability, and rapid heart rate.  Parents do state that she does appear to breathe rapidly, tires somewhat with the feeding with increased respiratory effort and diaphoresis.  The patient is exclusively breast fed and feeding approximately 2 hours.  Upon arrival at Children's Hospital, the patient was found to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with the rate in excess of 258 beats per minute with a successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm with adenosine.

Liver edge is palpated at 3 cm below the costal margin and no masses or bruits detected.,X-RAYS:,  Review of the chest x-ray demonstrated a normal situs, normal heart size, and adequate pulmonary vascular markings.  There is a prominent thymus.  An echocardiogram demonstrated significant cyanotic congenital heart disease consisting of normal situs, a left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium, a criss-cross heart with atrioventricular discordance of the right atrium draining through the mitral valve into the left-sided morphologic left ventricle.  The left atrium drained through the tricuspid valve into a right-sided morphologic right ventricle.  There is a large inlet ventricular septal defect as pulmonary atresia.  The aorta was malopposed arising from the right ventricle in the anterior position with the left aortic arch.  There was a small vertical ductus as a sole source of pulmonary artery blood flow.  The central pulmonary arteries appeared confluent although small measuring 3 mm in the diameter.  Biventricular function is well maintained.,FINAL IMPRESSION: , The patient has significant cyanotic congenital heart disease physiologically with a single ventricle physiology and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow and the incidental supraventricular tachycardia now in the sinus rhythm with adequate ventricular function.  The saturations are now also adequate on prostaglandin E1.,RECOMMENDATION: , My recommendation is that the patient be continued on prostaglandin E1.  The patient's case was presented to the cardiothoracic surgical consultant, Dr. X.  The patient will require further echocardiographic study in the morning to further delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy and confirm the central confluence.  A consideration will be made for diagnostic cardiac catheterization to fully delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy prior to surgical intervention.  The patient will require some form of systemic to pulmonary shunt, modified pelvic shunt or central shunt as a durable source of pulmonary blood flow.  Further surgical repair was continued on the size and location of the ventricular septal defect over the course of the time for consideration of possible Rastelli procedure.  The current recommendation is for proceeding with a central shunt and followed then by bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt with then consideration for a septation when the patient is 1 to 2 years of age.  These findings and recommendations were reviewed with the parents via a Spanish interpreter.","consult - history and phy., congenital heart disease, cyanotic, ductal-dependent, pulmonary blood flow, ventricular septal defect, blood flow, supraventricular tachycardia, tachycardia, ventricular, supraventricular, shunt, heart, pulmonary,"

The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.

He did have a CPK level of about 234 while his BUN and creatinine on admission were 109 and 6.9.  Despite IV hydration fluids, his potassium has gone up from 5.4 to 6.1.  He did not put out any significant urine and his weight was documented at 103 kg.  He was given a dose of Kayexalate.  His potassium came down to like about 5.9 and urine studies were ordered.  His urinalysis did show that he had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and his protein-creatinine ratio was about 9 gm of protein consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria.  He did have a low albumin of 1.9.  He denied any nonsteroidal usage, any recreational drug abuse, and his urine drug screen was unremarkable, and he denied any history of hypertension or any other medical problems.  He has not had any blood work except for drug screens that are required by work and no work up by any primary care physician because he has not seen one for primary care.  He is very concerned because his mother and father were both on dialysis, which he thinks were due to diabetes and both parents have expired.  He denied any hemoptysis, gross hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hemoptysis, hematemesis, no seizures, no palpitations, no pruritus, no chest pain.  He did have a decrease in his appetite, which all started about Thursday.  We were asked to see this patient in consultation by Dr. X because of his renal failure and the need for possible dialysis therapy.  He was significantly hypertensive on admission with a blood pressure of 162/80.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Both mother and father were on dialysis of end-stage renal disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married.  He does smoke despite understanding the risks associated with smoking a pack every 6 days.  Does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drug use.  He was on no prescribed medications.  He did have a fairly normal PSA of about 119 and I had ordered a renal ultrasound which showed fairly normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass, but it was consistent with increased echogenicity in the cortex, findings representative of medical renal disease.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital signs:  Blood pressure is 153/77, pulse 66, respiration 18, temperature 98.5.,General:  He was alert and oriented x 3, in no apparent distress, well-developed male.,HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.

No JVD, adenopathy, or bruit.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without a rub.,Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.,Extremities:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis.  He did have 2+ pretibial edema in both lower extremities.,Neurologic:  No gross focal findings.,Skin:  Showed no active skin lesions.,LABORATORY DATA: , Sodium 138, potassium 6.1, chloride 108, CO2 22, glucose 116, BUN 111, creatinine 7.29, estimated GFR 10 mL/minute.  Calcium 7.4 with an albumin of 1.9.  Mag normal at 2.2.  Urine culture negative at 12 hours.  His Random urine sodium was low at 12.  Random urine protein was 4756, and creatinine in the urine was 538.  Urine drug screen was unremarkable.  Troponin was within normal limits.  Phosphorus slightly elevated at 5.7.  CPK level was 234, white blood cells 6.5, hemoglobin 12.2, platelet count 188,000 with 75% segs.  PT 10.0, INR 1.0, PTT at 27.3.  B-natriuretic peptide 718.  Urinalysis showed 3+ protein, 4+ blood, negative nitrites, and trace leukocytes, 5 to 10 wbc's, greater than 100 rbc's, occasional fine granular casts, and moderate transitional cells.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Acute kidney injury of which etiology is unknown at this time, with progressive azotemia unresponsive to IV fluids.,2.  Hyperkalemia due to renal failure, slowly improving with Kayexalate.,3.  Microscopic hematuria with nephrotic range proteinuria, more consistent with a glomerulonephropathy nephritis.,4.  Hypertension.,PLAN: , I will give him Kayexalate 15 gm p.o. q.6h. x 2 more doses since he is responding and his potassium is already down to 5.2.  I will also recheck a urinalysis, consult the surgeon in the morning for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement, and consult case managers to start work on a transfer to ABCD Center per the patient and his wife's request, which will occur after his second dialysis treatment if he remains stable.  We will get a BMP, phosphorus, mag, CBC in the morning since he was given 80 mg of Lasix for fluid retention.  We will also give him 10 mg of Zaroxolyn p.o.  Discontinue all IV fluids.  Check an ANCA hepatitis profile, C3 and C4 complement levels along with CH 50 level.  I did discuss with the patient and his wife the need for kidney biopsy and they would like the kidney biopsy to be performed closer to home at Ochsner where his family is, since he only showed up here because of the nearest hospital located to his offshore job.  I do agree with getting him transferred once he is stable from his hyperkalemia and he starts his dialysis.,I appreciate consult.  I did discuss with him the importance of the kidney biopsies to direct treatment, finding the underlying etiology of his acute renal failure and to also give him prognostic factors of renal recovery.",
4136," Request for consultation to evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.", Consult - History and Phy., Request For Consultation ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Please evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a very pleasant 57-year old white female, a native of Cuba, being seen for evaluation and treatment of sores in her mouth that she has had for the last 10-12 days.  The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.  ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, Reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosions on the areas today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.  ,IMPRESSION: , Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.  ,I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  ,RECOMMENDED THERAPY: ,I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients’ skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.  ,Thank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  I will follow her with you as needed.","consult - history and phy., stomatitis, nsaid, blistering, blisters, buccal mucosa, dermatitis, erosive stomatitis, gastrointestinal, methotrexate, mouth, rheumatoid arthritis, stomatitis conditions, superficial erosions, upper respiratory infection, illness, medication"

She would usually have pustular type of lesion that would eventually break and would be quite painful.  The drainage would be malodorous.  It would initially not be infected as far as she knows, but then could eventually become infected.  She stated that this first started after she had her first born about 2 years ago.  She had recurrences of these abscesses and had pain, actually hospitalized at Hospital approximately a year and a half ago for about 1-1/2 months.  She was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics.  She had biopsies done.  She was seen by Dr. X.  Reportedly, she had a HIV test done that was negative.  She had been seen by a dermatologist who said that she had a problem with her sweat glands.  She has been on multiple courses of antibiotics.  She never had any fevers.  She has pain, drainage, and reportedly there was some bleeding in the area of the perineum/vaginal area.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  History of recurrent abscesses in the perineum, upper medial thigh, and the vulva area for about 2 years.

4141," Acute renal failure, suspected, likely due to multi-organ system failure syndrome.", Consult - History and Phy., Renal Failure - Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Acute renal failure.,HISTORY: , Limited data is available; I have reviewed his admission notes. Apparently this man was found down by a family member, was taken to Medical Center, and subsequently flown here. He has got respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure syndrome, and has renal insufficiency, as well. Markers of renal function have been fairly stable. I do not presently see indicators that he historically has been oliguric. The BUN and creatinine have been fairly stable. It is not clear whether he was taking his lisinopril up until the time of his demise, and it is also not clear whether he was taking his diuretic. Earlier thoughts had been that he could have had rhabdomyolysis, but the highest CPK I find recorded is 1500, the phosphorus is not elevated, though I acknowledge the serum calcium is low. I see no markers of myoglobinuria nor serum level of myoglobin. He has received IV fluid resuscitation, good broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, continues mechanically ventilated, and is on parenteral nutrition.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Not obtained from the patient, but is reviewed in other physician's notes and seems notable for probably atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease wherein he was taking Imdur and digoxin, reportedly. A suggestion of hypertensive disease versus BPH, he was on terazosin. Suggestion of CHF versus hypertension versus volume overload, treated with Lasix. He was iron, I presume for anemia. He was on potassium, lisinopril and aspirin.,ALLERGIES:, OTHER PHYSICIAN'S NOTES INDICATE NO KNOWN ALLERGIES.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Not available.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, Not available.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Not available.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: An older white male who is intubated, edematous, and appears uncomfortable.,HEENT: Male pattern baldness. Pupils equally round, no icterus. Intubated. OG tube in place.,NECK: Not tested for suppleness, no carotid bruits are heard. Neck vein distention is not seen.,LUNGS: He has diffuse expiratory wheezing anteriorly, laterally and posteriorly. I would describe the wheezes as coarse. I hear no present rales. Breath sounds otherwise are symmetrical.,HEART: Heart tones regular to auscultation, currently without audible rub or gallop sounds.,BREASTS: Not enlarged.,ABDOMEN: On plane. Bowel sounds presently are normal. Abdomen, I believe, is soft on plane, normal bowel sounds, no bruits, no liver edge felt, no HJR, no spleen tip, no suprapubic fullness.,GU: Catheter draining a dark yellow urine.,EXTREMITIES: Very edematous. Pulses not palpable. Cyanosis not observed. Fungal changes are not observed.,NEUROLOGICAL: Not otherwise assessed.,LABORATORY DATA:, Reviewed.,IMPRESSION:,1. Acute renal failure, suspected. Likely due to multi-organ system failure syndrome, with antecedent lisinopril use at home and at time of demise. He also reportedly was on Lasix prior to hospitalization, ? hypovolemia as a consequence.,2. Multi-organ system failure/systemic inflammatory response syndrome, with septic shock.,3. I am under-whelmed presently with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, if the maximum CK recorded is 1500.,4. Antecedent hypoxemia, with renal hypoperfusion.,5. Diffuse aspiration pneumonitis suggested.,DISCUSSION/PLAN: ,I think the renal function will follow the patient. Supportive care, attention to stability of a euvolemic state, will be important at this time. He is currently nonoliguric, has apparently stable, diffuse, bilateral wheezing, with adequate gas exchange. He is on TPN, antimicrobials, and has been on vasopressive agents. Blood pressures are close to acceptable, he may now be wearing off his lisinopril, assuming he was taking it prior to admission.,I would use diuretics to maintain central euvolemia. Recorded I's are substantially O's during the course of the hospitalization, I presume as part of his resuscitation effort. No central pressures or monitoring of same is currently available. I will follow with you. No present indication for hemodialysis. Antimicrobials are being handled by others.",

Again, the mother gives a very confusing sleep history but it does not truly sound like the child is having apneic events that are obstructive in nature.  It sounds like he is snoring loudly and does have some nasal obstruction at nighttime.  He also is sniffing a lot through his nose.  He has been tried on some nasal steroids but they only use this on a p.r.n. basis about one or two days every month and we are unsure if that has even helped at all, probably not.

Again, the mother gives a confusing sleep history but it does not really sound like he is having apneic events.  They deny any actual gasping events.  It sounds like true obstructive events.  He clearly has some symptoms at this point that would suggest possible allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinitis.  I think the most appropriate way to proceed would be to first try this child on a nasal corticosteroid and use it appropriately.  I have given them prescription for Nasacort Aqua one spray to each nostril twice a day.  I instructed them on correct way to use this and the importance to use it on a daily basis.  They may not see any benefit for several weeks.  I would like to evaluate him in six weeks to see how we are progressing.  If he continues to have problems, I think at that point we may consider performing a transnasal exam in the office to examine his adenoid bed and that would really be the only surgical option for this child.  He may also need an allergy evaluation at that point if he continues to have problems.  However, I would like to be fairly conservative in this child.  Should the mother still have concerns regarding his sleeping at our next visit or should his symptoms worsen (I did instruct her call us if it worsens), we may even need to pursue a sleep study just to settle that issue once and for all.  We will see him back in six weeks.","consult - history and phy., recurrent nasal obstruction, allergic rhinitis, apneic events, sleep apnea, nasal obstruction, nasal, apnea, allergic, obstruction, sleep, "

She notes starting in January, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  It turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  The patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  They had moved to ABCD where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  She also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  She has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  Some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  In January, she went on citalopram.  She reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, has trouble sleeping at night, thinks perhaps her mood got worse on the citalopram, which is possible, though it is also possible that the progressive nature of getting divorce than financial problems has contributed to her worsening mood.,PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , She was born in XYZ.  She describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  Father was a truckdriver.  She is an only child.  She reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  In her 20s, she served six years in Naval Reserve.  She was previously married for four years.  She described that as an abusive relationship.

I, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  If needed, she can take Prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  She does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with Prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information I can provide.","consult - history and phy., citalopram, depressive disorder, overdose, warfarin, restless legs syndrome, disorder, mood"

However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, airway, laryngology, shiley, alteration of voice, bronchi, bronchoscopy, cannula, cartilage, cricoid, flexible, foreign body, mainstem, obstruction, perichondrium, stenosis, stent, subglottic, swallowing, trachea, tracheal, tracheal stenosis, tracheostomy, shiley single cannula tracheostomy, shiley single cannula, single cannula tracheostomy, thyroid isthmus, stent material, tracheostomy tube, tube, thyroid, "

The patient with extensive smoking history who presents after risks, complications, and consequences of the SCOOP FastTract procedure were explained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to operating suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After this, the patient was then placed under total IV anesthesia and the operating bed was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg.  The patient's sternal notch along with cricoid and thyroid cartilages were noted and palpated and a sternal marker was utilized to mark the cricoid cartilage in the sternal notch.  The midline was also marked and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 at approximately 4 cc total was then utilized to localize the neck.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped with Hibiclens.  A skin incision was then made in the midline with a #15 Bard-Parker in a vertical fashion.  After this, the skin was retracted laterally and a small anterior jugular branch was clamped and cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties.  Further bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization and attention was then drawn down on to the strap muscles.  The patient's sternohyoid muscle was identified and grasped on either side and the midline raphe was identified.  Cauterization was then utilized to take down the midline raphe and further dissection was utilized with the skin hook and stat clamps.  The anterior aspect of the thyroid isthmus was identified and palpation on the cricoid cartilage was performed.  The cricoid cauterization over the cricoid cartilage was obtained with the monopolar cauterization and blunt dissection then was carried along the posterior aspect of the thyroid isthmus.  Stats were then placed on either side of the thyroid isthmus and the mid portion was bisected with the monopolar cauterization.  After this, the patient's anterior trachea was then identified and cleaned with pusher.  After this, the cricoid cartilage along the first and second tracheal rings was identified.  The cricoid hook was placed and the trachea was brought more anteriorly and superiorly.  After this, the patient's head incision was placed below the second tracheal ring with a #15 Bard-Parker.  After this, the patient had a tracheal punch with the SCOOP FastTract kit to create a small 4 mm punch within the tracheal cartilage.  After this, the patient then had a tracheal stent placed within the tracheal punched lumen and the patient was then had the tracheal stent secured to the neck with a Vicryl strap.  After this, the cricoid hook was removed and the patient then had FiO2 on the monitor noted with pulse oximetry of 100%.  The patient was then turned back to the anesthesia and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and will stay in the hospital for approximately 23 hours.  The patient will have the stent guidewire removed with a scoop catheter 11 cm placed.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, oxygen dependency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tracheostomy, scoop procedure, nasal cannula, scoop procedure fasttract, thyroid isthmus, cricoid cartilage, isthmus, oxygen, dependency, scoop, cartilages"

4631, Patient referred for evaluation of tracheostomy tube placement and treatment recommendations., Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Tracheostomy Tube Consult ,"HISTORY:  ,I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient today, referred for evaluation of tracheostomy tube placement and treatment recommendations.  As you are well aware, he is a pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who unfortunately is suffering from end-stage COPD, who required tracheostomy tube placement about three months ago when being treated for acute exacerbation of COPD and having difficulty coming off ventilatory support.  He now resides in an extended care facility with a capped tracheostomy tube, and he unfortunately states he has had not had to use the tracheostomy tube since his discharge and admission to the extended care facility.  He requires constant oxygen administration and has been having no problems with shortness of breath, worsening, requiring opening the tracheostomy tube site.  He states there has been some tenderness associated with the tracheostomy tube and difficulty with swallowing and he wishes to have it removed.  Apparently there is no history of any airway issues while sleeping or need for uncapping the tube and essentially the tube has just remained present for months capped in his neck.  No history of any previous tracheostomy tube insertion.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , COPD, history of hypercarbic hypoxemia, history of coronary artery disease, history of previous myocardial infarction, and history of liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, hernia repair, and tracheostomy.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Strong for heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular accident.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Prevacid, folic acid, aspirin, morphine sulfate, Pulmicort, Risperdal, Colace, clonazepam, Lotrisone, Roxanol, Ambien, Zolpidem tartrate, simethicone, Robitussin, and prednisone.,ALLERGIES: , Nitroglycerin.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient has a 25-year-smoking history, which I believe is quite heavy and he has a significant alcohol use in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 64, blood pressure is 110/78, pulse 96, and temperature is 98.6.,GENERAL:  The patient was examined in his wheelchair, resting comfortably, in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.,EARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.,NOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.,THROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.,NECK:  The patient has a stable-appearing tracheostomy tube site and the stoma appears to be without signs of infection.  The previous incision was vertical in nature and there is no hypertrophic scar formation.  No adenopathy noted.  No stridor noted.,NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerve VII intact bilaterally.

History of coronary artery disease.,4.  History of myocardial infarction.,5.  History of cirrhosis of liver.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I discussed with the patient in detail after fiberoptic laryngoscopy and limited bronchoscopy was performed in the office whether or not to pull out the tracheostomy tube.  His vocal cords moved well, and I do not see any signs of granuloma or airway obstruction either in the supraglottic or subglottic region, and I felt he would tolerate the tube being removed with close monitoring by nursing at his extended care facility.  I did impress the fact that I believe he probably will have other events requiring airway support, which could include intubation, and if the intubation is prolonged a tracheostomy may be needed.  Creation of a long-term tracheostoma may be beneficial whereas the patient would not need such a long tracheostomy tube, and I informed the patient there are other options other than the tube he has at the present time.  The patient still wished to have the tube removed and he is aware he may need to have it replaced or he may have trouble with the area healing or scarring or he could end up having an emergent airway situation with the tube gone, but wishes to have it removed, and I did remove it today.  Dressing was applied and we will see him back next week to make sure everything is healing properly.",

General inhalational anesthesia was administered through the patient's existing 4.0 endotracheal tube.  The neck was extended and secured with tape and incision in the midline of the neck approximately 2 fingerbreadths above the sternal notch was outlined.  The incision measured approximately 1 cm and was just below the palpable cricoid cartilage and first tracheal ring.  The incision area was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000.  A #67 blade was used to perform the incision.  Electrocautery was used to remove excess fat tissue to expose the strap muscles.  The strap muscles were grasped and divided in the midline with a cutting electrocautery.  Sharp dissection was used to expose the anterior trachea and cricoid cartilage.  The thyroid isthmus was identified crossing just below the cricoid cartilage.  This was divided in the midline with electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was used to expose adequate cartilaginous rings.  A 4.0 silk was used for stay sutures to the midline of the cricoid.  Additional stay sutures were placed on each side of the third tracheal ring.  Thin DuoDerm was placed around the stoma.  The tracheal incision was performed with a #11 blade through the second, third, and fourth tracheal rings.  The cartilaginous edges were secured to the skin edges with interrupted #4-0 Monocryl.  A 4.5 PED tight-to-shaft cuffed Bivona tube was placed and secured with Velcro ties.  A flexible scope was passed through the tracheotomy tube.

Next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw.  The chest retractor was positioned.  Next, full-dose heparin was given.  The pericardium was opened.  Pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  After obtaining adequate ACT, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 double pursestring of Ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  A 4-0 U-stitch was placed in the right atrium.  A retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site.  Next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein.  A 4-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein.  Next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position.  We then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  The aorta was completely encircled.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.  We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.  We backed up our flows.  We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.  The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit.  Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures.  In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view.  Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets.  Care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus.  We then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine Toronto valve.  We prepared the valve.  Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus.  We started with our individual commissural stitches.  They were connected to our valve sewing ring.  Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position.  After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve.  The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.  Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  Next, we sewed our distal suture line.  We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.  We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve.  Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.  This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.  Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia.  Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point we inspected our aortic valve.  There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open.  We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.  We now turned our attention to closing the aorta.  A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.  Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp.  The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.  We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.  We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  We oversewed that site with a 5-0 Prolene.  By now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity.  We began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.  We then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula.  We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.  We also placed 2 Blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions.  They were brought out through the skin.  The sternum was closed with #7 wires in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl.  We closed the subcu tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 PDS.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, cardioplegia, toronto stentless porcine valve, tycron sutures, coronary ostia, porcine valve, retrograde cardioplegia, cardiopulmonary bypass, sutures, valve, insertion, toronto, aortic, stentless, chest, coronary, porcine, cardiopulmonary, prolene, atrial, bypass, heart, aorta,"

There was stenosis in the mid-venous limb of the graft.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is an 81-year-old African-American female who presents with an occluded left forearm loop graft.  She was not able to have her dialysis as routine.  Her potassium was dramatically elevated at 7 the initial evening of anticipated surgery.  Both Surgery and Anesthesia thought this would be too risky to do.  Thus, she was given medications to decrease her potassium and a temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed in the femoral vein noted for her to have dialysis that night as well as this morning.  This morning her predialysis potassium was 6, and thus she was scheduled for surgery after her dialysis.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A transverse incision was made at the region of the venous anastomosis of the graft.  Further dissection was carried down to the catheter.  The vein appeared to be soft and without thrombus.  This outflow did not appear to be significantly impaired.  A transverse incision was made with a #11 blade on the venous limb of the graft near the anastomosis.  Next, a thrombectomy was done using a #4 Fogarty catheter.  Some of the clot and thrombus was removed from the venous limb.  The balloon did hang up in the multiple places along the venous limb signifying some degree of stenosis.  Once removing most of the clots from the venous limb prior to removing the plug, dilators were passed down the venous limb also indicating the area of stenosis.  At this point, we felt the patient would benefit from a curettage of the venous limb of the graft.  This was done and subsequent passes with the dilator and the balloon were then very easy and smooth following the curettage.  The Fogarty balloon was then passed beyond the clot and the plug.  The plug was visualized and inspected.  This also gave a good brisk bleeding from the graft.  The patient was heparinized and hep saline solution was injected into the venous limb and the angle vascular clamp was applied to the venous limb.  Attention was directed up to its anastomosis and the vein.  Fogarty balloon and thrombectomy was also performed well enough into this way.  There was good venous back bleeding following this.  The area was checked for any stenosis with the dilators and none was present.  Next, a #6-0 Prolene suture was used in a running fashion to close the graft.  Just prior to tying the suture, the graft was allowed to flush to move any debris or air.  The suture was also checked at that point for augmentation, which was good.  The suture was tied down and the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues and a #4-0 undyed Vicryl was used in a running subcuticular fashion to approximate the skin edges.  Steri-Strips were applied and the patient was taken to recovery in stable condition.  She tolerated the procedure well.  She will be discharged from recovery when stable.  She is to resume her regular dialysis schedule and present for dialysis tomorrow.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, thrombosed, hyperkalemia, thrombectomy, forearm loop graft, venous outflow, chronic renal failure, venous limb, loop graft, forearm loop, limb, forearm, graft, venous, anastomosis, stenosis,"

Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring lines were placed.  The chest, abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The greater saphenous vein was harvested from the right upper leg through interrupted skin incisions and was prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 silk and flushing with vein solution.  The leg was closed with running 3-0 Dexon subcu, and running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular on the skin, and later wrapped.  A median sternotomy incision was made and the left internal mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff at the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The sternum was closed.  A right carotid incision was made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and carried down to and through the platysma.  The deep fascia was divided.  The facial vein was divided between clamps and tied with 2-0 silk.  The common carotid artery, takeoff of the external and internal carotid arteries were dissected free, with care taken to identify and preserve the hypoglossal and vagus nerves.  The common carotid artery was double-looped with umbilical tape, takeoff of the external was looped with a heavy silk, distal internal was double-looped with a heavy silk.  Shunts were prepared.  A patch was prepared.  Heparin 50 mg was given IV.  Clamp was placed on the beginning of the takeoff of the external and the proximal common carotid artery.  Distal internal was held with a forceps.  Internal carotid artery was opened with 11-blade.  Potts scissors were then used to extend the aortotomy through the lesion into good internal carotid artery beyond.  The shunt was placed and proximal and distal snares were tightened.  Endarterectomy was carried out under direct vision in the common carotid artery and the internal reaching a fine, feathery distal edge using eversion on the external.  All loose debris was removed and Dacron patch was then sutured in place with running 6-0 Prolene suture, removing the shunt just prior to completing the suture line.  Suture line was completed and the neck was packed.,The pericardium was opened.  A pericardial cradle was created.  The patient was heparinized for cardiopulmonary bypass, cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula.  A retrograde cardioplegia cannula was placed with a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene into the coronary sinus, and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  An antegrade cardioplegia needle sump was placed in the ascending aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  The ascending aorta was cross-clamped and cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given antegrade, a total of 5 cc per kg.  This was followed sumping of the ascending aorta and retrograde cardioplegia, a total of 5 cc per kg to the coronary sinus.  The obtuse marginal 1 coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The vein was cut to length.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.  The obtuse marginal 2 was not felt to be suitable for bypass, therefore, the posterior descending of the right coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture to reverse autogenous saphenous vein.  The vein was cut to length.  The mammary was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.

There was a narrowing in the mid portion of the venous limb of the graft, which was dilated with a #5 coronary dilator.  The Fogarty catheter was then passed up the vein, but no clot was obtained.  A patch PTFE material was fashioned and was sutured over the graftotomy with running 6-0 Gore-Tex suture.  Clamps were removed and flow established.  A thrill was easily palpable.  Hemostasis was achieved and the wound was irrigated and closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous suture followed by 4-0 nylon on the skin.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, instrument and needle counts were reported as correct.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, angioplasty, venous, anastomosis, patch angioplasty, av shunt, venous anastomosis, av, thrombectomy, thrombosed, arteriovenous, vein, forearm, shunt,"

Intercostal nerve block for postoperative pain relief at five levels.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This is an 84-year-old lady who was referred by Dr. A for treatment of her left upper lobe carcinoma.  The patient has a history of lymphoma and is in remission.  An enlarged right axillary lymph node was biopsied recently and was negative for lymphoma.  A mass in the left upper lobe was biopsied with fine-needle aspiration and shown to be a primary non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung.  PET scan was, otherwise, negative for spread and resection was advised.  All the risk and benefits were fully explained to the patient and she elected to proceed as planned.  She was transferred to rehab for couple of weeks to buildup strength before the surgery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  In the operating room under anesthesia, she was prepped and draped suitably.  Dr. B was the staff anesthesiologist.  Left muscle sparing mini thoracotomy was made.  The serratus and latissimus muscles were not cut but moved out to the way.  Access to the chest was obtained through the fifth intercostal space.  Two Tuffier retractors of right angles provided adequate exposure.,The inferior pulmonary ligament was not dissected free and lymph nodes from the station 9 were now sent for pathology.  The parietal pleural reflexion around the hilum was now circumcised, and lymph nodes were taken from station 8 and station 5.,The branches of the pulmonary artery to the upper lobe were now individually stapled with a 30/2.5 staple gun or/and the smaller one were ligated with 2-0 silk.  The left superior pulmonary vein was transected using a TA30/2.5 staple gun, and the fissure was completed using firings of an endo-GIA 60/4.8 staple gun.  Finally, the left upper lobe bronchus was transected using a TA30/4.8 staple gun.  Please note, that this patient had been somewhat unusual variant of a small bronchus that was coming out posterior to the main trunk of the pulmonary artery and supplying a small section of the posterior portion of the left upper lobe.,The specimen was delivered and sent to pathology.  The mass was clearly palpable in the upper portion of the lingular portion of this left upper lobe.  Frozen section showed that the margin was negative.,The chest was irrigated with warm sterile water and when the left lower lobe inflated, there was no air leak.  A single 32-French chest tube was inserted, and intercostal block was done with Marcaine infiltrated two spaces above and two spaces below thus achieving a block at five levels 30 mL of Marcaine was used all together.  A #2 Vicryl pericostal sutures were now applied.  The serratus and latissimus muscles retracted back in place.  A #19 French Blake drain placed in the subcutaneous tissues and 2-0 Vicryl used for the fat followed by 4-0 Monocryl for the skin.

A time-out process had been followed and preoperative antibiotics were given.,The patient was positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed.  It included the previous incision.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  Actually, there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke.  Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura.  We aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity.  The sample was taken for culture and sensitivity.,Then, at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm.  Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung.  Further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent.,Then, we were left with the trapped lung.  It was trapped by thickened visceral pleura.  This was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively.  Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily.  There was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I was not able to fill.  This area, of course, was very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that.  Two large chest tubes were placed.  The cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline.  Then, the thoracotomy was closed in layers using heavy stitches of Vicryl as pericostal sutures and then several figure-of-eight interrupted sutures to the muscle layers and a combination of nylon stitches and staples to the skin.,The chest tubes were affixed to the skin with heavy sutures of silk.  Dressings were applied and the patient was put back in the supine position and after a few minutes of observation and evaluation, he was able to be extubated in the operating room.,Estimated blood loss was about 500 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well and was sent to the ICU in a satisfactory condition.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, total pulmonary decortication, pulmonary decortication, parietal pleurectomy, endotracheal tube, chest retractor, chest tubes, parietal pleura, pleurectomy, empyema, endotracheal, thoracotomy, pleura, chest "

A thoracostomy tube was placed at the bedside with only partial resolution of the pleural effusion.  On CT scan evaluation, there is evidence of an entrapped right lower lobe with loculations.  Decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention for a complete decortication and the patient understands the need for surgery and signed the preoperative informed consent.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department.  Intraoperative bronchoscopy was performed by Dr. Y and evaluation of carina, left upper and lower lobes with segmental evidence of diffuse mucous, thick secretions which were thoroughly lavaged with sterile saline lavage.  Samples were obtained from both the left and the right subbronchiole segments for Gram stain cultures and ASP evaluation.  The right bronchus lower, middle, and upper were also examined and subsegmental bronchiole areas were thoroughly examined with no evidence of masses, lesions, or suspicious extrinsic compressions on the bronchi.  At this point, all mucous secretions were thoroughly irrigated and aspirated until the airways were clear.  Bronchoscope was then removed.  Vital signs remained stable throughout this portion of the procedure.  The patient was re-intubated by Anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube.  At this point, the patient was repositioned in the left lateral decubitus position with protection of all pressure points and the table was extended in customary fashion.  At this point, the right chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The chest tube was removed before prepping the patient and the prior thoracostomy site was cleansed thoroughly with Betadine.  The first port was placed through this incision intrathoracically.  A bronchoscope was placed for inspection of the intrathoracic cavity.  Pictures were taken.  There is extensive fibrinous exudate noted under parietal and visceral pleura, encompassing the lung surface, diaphragm, and the posterolateral aspect of the right thorax.  At this point, a second port site anteriorly was placed under direct visualization.  With the aid of the thoracoscopic view, a Yankauer resection device was placed in the thorax and blunt decortication was performed and aspiration of reminder of the pleural fluid.  Due to the gelatinous nature of the fibrinous exudate, there were areas of right upper lobe that adhered to the chest wall and the middle and lower lobes appeared entrapped.  Due to the extensive nature of the disease, decision was made to open the chest in a formal right thoracotomy fashion.  Incision was made.  The subcutaneous tissues were then electrocauterized down to the level of the latissimus dorsi, which was separated with electrocautery down to the anterior 6th rib space.  The chest cavity was entered with the right lung deflated per Anesthesia at our request.  Once the intrathoracic cavity was accessed, a thorough decortication was performed in meticulous systematic fashion starting with the right upper lobe, middle, and the right lower lobe.  With the expansion of the lung and reduction of the pleural surface fibrinous extubate, warm irrigation was used and the lungs allowed to re-expand.  There was no evidence of gross leakage or bleeding at the conclusion of surgery.,Full lung re-expansion was noted upon re-inflation of the lung.  Two #32 French thoracostomy tubes were placed, one anteriorly straight and one posteriorly on the diaphragmatic sulcus.  The chest tubes were secured in place with #0-silk sutures and placed on Pneumovac suction.  Next, the ribs were reapproximated with five interrupted CTX sutures and latissimus dorsi was then reapproximated with a running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Next, subcutaneous skin was closed sequentially with a cosmetic layered subcutaneous closure.  Steri-Strips were applied along with sterile occlusive dressings.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the operating room.  The chest tubes were maintained on Pleur-Evac suction for full re-expansion of the lung.  The patient was transported to the recovery with vital signs stable.  Stat portable chest x-ray is pending.

He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room.  He was placed in a supine position on the operating table.  After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll.  Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion.  After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace.  The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered.  The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure.  The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.,Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid.  Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis.  The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated.  A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed.  There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity.  The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored.  The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus.  It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area.  The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair.  After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French.  These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.,The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures.  The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.,The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position.  A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed.  A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced.  The laparoscope was introduced.  A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced.  It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance.  The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely.  The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique.  Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire.  #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated.  We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall.  The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position.  As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube.  Sterile dressing was applied.

There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT.  The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  Many cultures were taken from several areas.  The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.  When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures.,Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed.  The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel.  After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,Good hemostasis was observed.  Sponge count was reported as being correct.  Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl.  The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  Sterile dressings were applied.

Patient was placed in the thoracoabdominal position with the left chest up and the hips back to a 30-degree angle.  The left groin, abdominal and chest were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A thoracoabdominal incision was made.  The 8th interspace was entered.  The costal margin was divided.  The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta.  The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm.  It was dissected free circumferentially.  The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries.  The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this.  The patient was heparinized.  Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.  A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow.  Bypass was instituted.  The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm.  The area was divided at this point.  A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  The graft was brought into the diaphragm.  Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off.  The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation.  The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch.  The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference.  The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels.  The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established.  An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  An area of graft was removed.  The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.

Preoperative evaluation included a CT scan, which showed focal mass.  CT and PET confirmed anterior lesion.  Therefore the patient was seen in our thoracic tumor board where it was recommended to have resection performed with chest wall reconstruction.  In the outpatient setting, the patient was willing to proceed.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient identified correctly.  She was taken to the operating room where an epidural catheter was placed by Anesthesia without difficulty.  She was sedated and intubated with double-lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty.  She was positioned with left side up.  Appropriate pressure points were padded.  The left chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  The skin incision was made in the posterior axillary line, approximately 7th intercostal space with #10 blade, taken down through tissues and Bovie electrocautery.,Pleura was entered.  There was good deflation of the left lung.  __________ port was placed, followed by the 0-degree 10-mm scope with appropriate patient positioning.  Posteriorly a pedunculated 2.5 x 3-cm pleural-based mass was identified on the anterior chest wall.  There were thin adhesions to the pleura, but no invasion of the chest wall that could be identified.  The tumor was very mobile and was on a pedunculated stalk, approximately 1.5 cm.  It was felt that this could be resected without the need of chest wall reconstruction because of the narrow stalk.,Therefore a 2nd port was placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 8th intercostal space in the usual fashion.  Camera was placed through this port.  Laparoscopic scissors were placed through the posterior port, but it was necessary to have another instrument to provide more tension than just gravity.  Therefore because of the need to bring the specimen through the chest wall, a small 3-cm thoracotomy was made, which incorporated the posterior port site.  This was taken down to the subcutaneous tissue with Bovie electrocautery.  Periosteal elevator was used to lift the intercostal muscle off.  The ribs were not spread.  Through this 3-cm incision, both the laparoscopic scissors as well as Prestige graspers could be placed.  Prestige graspers were used to pull the specimen from the chest wall.  Care was taken not to injure the capsule.  The laparoscopic scissors on cautery were used to resect the parietal pleural off of the chest wall.  Care was taken not to transect the stalk.  Specimen came off the chest wall very easily.  There was good hemostasis.,At this point, the EndoCatch bag was placed through the incision.  Specimen was placed in the bag and then removed from the field.  There was good hemostasis.  Camera was removed.  A 24-French chest tube was placed through the anterior port and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  The posterior port site was closed 1st with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion for the intercostal muscle layer, followed by 2-0 closure of the latissimus fascia as well as subdermal suture, 4-0 Monocryl was used for the skin, followed by Steri-Strips and sterile drapes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, mini thoracotomy, pleural based mass, pleural based nodule, chest wall, mesothelioma focal, pleural, chest, thoracotomy, mesothelioma, laparoscopic, thoracoscopy, "

His left back was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was used to infiltrate his chest wall and the chest entered upon the ninth intercostal space in the midscapular line and the thoracentesis catheter was used and placed, and then we proceed to draw by hand about 1200 mL blood.  This blood was nonclotting and it was tested twice.  Halfway during the procedure, the patient felt that he was getting dizzy and his pressure at that time had dropped to the 80s.  Therefore, we laid him off his right side while keeping the chest catheter in place.  At that time, I proceeded to continuously draw fluids slowly and then when the patient recovered we sat him up again and we proceed to complete the procedure.,Overall besides the described episode, the patient tolerated the procedure well and afterwards, we took another chest x-ray that showed much improvement in the pleural effusion and at that particular time, with all the history we proceeded to admit the patient for observation and with an idea to obtain a CT in the morning to see whether the patient would need an pigtail intrapleural catheter or not.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, pleural effusion, hemothorax, thoracentesis, chest,"

After obtaining the informed consent, the patient's posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line.  Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.  Therefore, I had to use a #18 spinal needle, which I had to use almost in its entire length to reach the fluid.  From then on, I proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 mL of a light milky fluid.,The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, but almost at the end of it she said that she was feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle.  At that time, it was getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after a few minutes the patient was feeling fine.  At any rate, we gave her bolus of 250 mL of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hours of observation.  We then thought that if she was doing fine, then we will send her home.,A chest x-ray was performed after the procedure which showed a dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there was no pneumothorax or no other obvious complications of her procedure.,","cardiovascular / pulmonary, malignant pleural effusion, chest wall, pleural effusion, dyspnea, thoracentesis, fluid, pleural, "

The patient is a product of a term pregnancy that was uncomplicated and no perinatal issues are raised.  Parents; however, did note the patient to be quite dusky since the time of her birth; however, were reassured by the pediatrician that this was normal.  The patient demonstrates good interval weight gain and only today presented to an outside hospital with significant duskiness, some irritability, and rapid heart rate.  Parents do state that she does appear to breathe rapidly, tires somewhat with the feeding with increased respiratory effort and diaphoresis.  The patient is exclusively breast fed and feeding approximately 2 hours.  Upon arrival at Children's Hospital, the patient was found to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with the rate in excess of 258 beats per minute with a successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm with adenosine.  The electrocardiogram following the cardioversion had demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a right atrial enlargement, northwest axis, and poor R-wave progression, possible right ventricular hypertrophy.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Family history is remarkable for an older sibling found to have a small ventricular septal defect that is spontaneously closed.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A complete review of systems including neurologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary are otherwise negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  Physical examination that showed a sedated, acyanotic infant who is in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate of 170, respiratory rate of 65, saturation, it is nasal cannula oxygen of 74% with a prostaglandin infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/minute.,HEENT:  Normocephalic with no bruit detected.  She had symmetric shallow breath sounds clear to auscultation.  She had full symmetrical pulses.,HEART:  There is normoactive precordium without a thrill.  There is normal S1, single loud S2, and a 2/6 continuous shunt type of murmur could be appreciated at the left upper sternal border.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  Liver edge is palpated at 3 cm below the costal margin and no masses or bruits detected.,X-RAYS:,  Review of the chest x-ray demonstrated a normal situs, normal heart size, and adequate pulmonary vascular markings.  There is a prominent thymus.  An echocardiogram demonstrated significant cyanotic congenital heart disease consisting of normal situs, a left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium, a criss-cross heart with atrioventricular discordance of the right atrium draining through the mitral valve into the left-sided morphologic left ventricle.  The left atrium drained through the tricuspid valve into a right-sided morphologic right ventricle.  There is a large inlet ventricular septal defect as pulmonary atresia.  The aorta was malopposed arising from the right ventricle in the anterior position with the left aortic arch.  There was a small vertical ductus as a sole source of pulmonary artery blood flow.  The central pulmonary arteries appeared confluent although small measuring 3 mm in the diameter.  Biventricular function is well maintained.,FINAL IMPRESSION: , The patient has significant cyanotic congenital heart disease physiologically with a single ventricle physiology and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow and the incidental supraventricular tachycardia now in the sinus rhythm with adequate ventricular function.  The saturations are now also adequate on prostaglandin E1.,RECOMMENDATION: , My recommendation is that the patient be continued on prostaglandin E1.  The patient's case was presented to the cardiothoracic surgical consultant, Dr. X.  The patient will require further echocardiographic study in the morning to further delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy and confirm the central confluence.  A consideration will be made for diagnostic cardiac catheterization to fully delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy prior to surgical intervention.  The patient will require some form of systemic to pulmonary shunt, modified pelvic shunt or central shunt as a durable source of pulmonary blood flow.  Further surgical repair was continued on the size and location of the ventricular septal defect over the course of the time for consideration of possible Rastelli procedure.  The current recommendation is for proceeding with a central shunt and followed then by bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt with then consideration for a septation when the patient is 1 to 2 years of age.  These findings and recommendations were reviewed with the parents via a Spanish interpreter.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, congenital heart disease, cyanotic, ductal-dependent, pulmonary blood flow, ventricular septal defect, blood flow, supraventricular tachycardia, tachycardia, ventricular, supraventricular, shunt, heart, pulmonary,"

Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .,I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.

She states that the methadone did not work for her.  She was ""immune"" to oxycodone.  She had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that.  There was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness.  She also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder.,Apparently, her husband was in this afternoon.  He had a box of her pain medications.  It is unclear whether she took a bunch of these or precisely what happened.  I was contacted that she was less responsive.  She periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications, which she has been requesting repeatedly, though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain.  The nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point.  There was a concern that she had taken some medications from home.  She was given Narcan and appeared to come around some.  Breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi, which certainly changed from this a.m.  Additional Narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse a possible benzodiazepine toxicity.  With O2 via mask, oxygenation was stable at 90% to 95% after initial hypoxia was noted.  A chest x-ray was obtained at this time.  An ECG was obtained, which shows a sinus tachycardia, noted to have ischemic abnormalities.,In light of the acute decompensation, she was then transferred to the ICU.  We will continue the IV Zosyn.  Respiratory protocol with respiratory management.  Continue alprazolam p.r.n., but avoid if she appears sedated.

The patient has had painful varicose veins for number of years.  He has failed conservative measures and has felt more aggressive treatment to alleviate his pain secondary to his varicose veins.  It was recommended that the patient undergo a saphenous vein ligation and stripping.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure including intractable pain.  He gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  The left greater saphenous vein femoral junction was identified and multiple tributaries were ligated surrounding this region.,The vein was stripped from the saphenofemoral junction to the level of the knee.  Multiple tributaries of the greater saphenous vein and varicose veins from the left lower extremity were ligated and stripped accordingly.  Additionally, there were noted to be multiple regions within these veins that were friable and edematous consistent with acute and chronic inflammatory changes making stripping of these varicose veins extremely difficult.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was marked preoperatively in the Preanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent general endotracheal intubation.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped circumferentially from the foot all the way to the distal section of the left lower quadrant and just right of midline.  A diagonal incision was created in the direction of the inguinal crease on the left.  A self-retaining retractor was placed and the incision was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues until the greater saphenous vein was identified.  The vein was isolated with a right angle.  The vein was followed proximally until a multiple tributary branches were identified.  These were ligated with #3-0 silk suture.  The dissection was then carried to the femorosaphenous vein junction.  This was identified and #0 silk suture was placed proximally and distally and ligated in between.  The proximal suture was tied down.  Distal suture was retracted and a vein stripping device was placed within the greater saphenous vein.  An incision was created at the level of the knee.  The distal segment of the greater saphenous vein was identified and the left foot was encircled with #0 silk suture and tied proximally and then ligated.  The distal end of the vein stripping device was then passed through at its most proximal location.  The device was attached to the vein stripping section and the greater saphenous vein was then stripped free from its canal within the left lower extremity.  Next, attention was made towards the multiple tributaries of the varicose vein within the left lower leg.  Multiple incisions were created with a #15 blade scalpel.  The incisions were carried down with electrocautery.  Next, utilizing sharp dissection with a hemostat, the tissue was spread until the vein was identified.  The vein was then followed to T3 and in all these locations intersecting segments of varicose veins were identified and removed.  Additionally, some segments were removed.  The stripping approach would be vein stripping device.  Multiple branches of the saphenous vein were then ligated and/or removed.  Occasionally, dissection was unable to be performed as the vein was too friable and would tear from the hemostat.  Bleeding was controlled with direct pressure.  All incisions were then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures and/or #4-0 Vicryl sutures.,The femoral incision was closed with interrupted multiple #3-0 Vicryl sutures and closed with a running #4-0 subcuticular suture.  The leg was then cleaned, dried, and then Steri-Strips were placed over the incisions.  The leg was then wrapped with a sterile Kerlix.  Once the Kerlix was achieved, an Ace wrap was placed over the left lower extremity for compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit extubated in stable condition.  He will undergo evaluation postoperatively and will be seen shortly in the postanesthesia care unit.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, varicose veins, saphenous vein, stripping, ligation, vein stripping, lower extremity, saphenous, varicose, vein, ligated, "

He then felt that his defibrillator was going off and this has continued and feels like his heart rate is not normal.  Thus, his dad put him in the car and transported him here.  He has been evaluated here.  He had some scar tissue at one point when the internal pacemaker was not working properly and had to have that replaced.  It was 2 a.m. when he woke, and again, he was brought here by private vehicle.  He was well prior to going to bed.  No cough, cold, runny nose, fever.  No trauma has been noted.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Shone complex, pacemaker dependent.,MEDICATIONS: , He is on no medications at this time.,ALLERGIES:,  He has no allergies.,IMMUNIZATIONS:,  Up to date.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He lives with his parents.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative.,REVIEW OF SYSTEM: , Twelve asked, all negative, except as noted above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  This is an awake, alert male, who appears to be in mild distress.,HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  His TMs are clear.  His nares are clear.  The mucous membranes are pink and moist.  Throat is clear.,NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or masses.  Trachea is midline.,LUNGS:  Clear.,HEART:  Shows bradycardia at 53.  He has good distal pulses.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  No guarding, no rebound.  No rashes are seen.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Initial blood pressure is 164/90.  He was moved in room 1.  He was placed on nasal cannula.  Pulse ox was 100%, which is normal.  We placed him on a monitor.  We did an EKG; it has not appear to be capturing his pacemaker at this time.  Shortly after the patient's arrival, the Medtronic technician came and worked out his pacemaker.  Medtronic representative informed me that the lead that he has in place has been recalled because it has been prone to microfractures, oversensing, and automatic defibrillation.  As noted, he was transferred to room 1, placed on a monitor, pulse ox.  An IV was placed.  A standard blood work was sent.  A chest x-ray was done showing normal heart size, lead appeared to be in placed.  There was no evidence of pulmonary edema.  His pacemaker did not appear to be capturing.  We placed him on transthoracic leads.  However, it is difficult to get good placement with these because of the area where his pacemaker was placed.  The Medtronic technician initially turned off his defibrillation mode and turned down his sensor.  However, we could not get our transthoracic pacer to capture his heart.  When the Medtronic representative turned off the pacemaker, the heart rate seemed to drop into the 40s.  The patient appeared to be in pain.  We placed it back on a rate of 60 at that time.  He has remained in sinus bradycardia, but no evidence of ectopic beats.  No widening of his QRS complex.  I spoke with Cardiology.  Cardiology service has come in, has evaluated him at bedside with me.  Again, we turned up the transthoracic pacer, but it is again not seem to be picking up, and his heart rate is still going with the Medtronic's internal pacemaker.  So with the ICU physician on call, Dr. X, he has agreed with taking this young man to the ICU.,An hour after presentation here, the ICU was ready for bed.  I accompanied the patient up to the ICU.  He remained awake and alert.  Initially, he was complaining of a lot of chest pain.  Once the defibrillator was turned off, he had no more pain.  He was transported to the Pediatrics PICU and delivered in stable condition.,LABORATORY DATA: , CBC was normal.  Chem-20 was normal as well.,IMPRESSION:  ,Complete heart block with pacemaker malfunction.,PLAN:  ,He is admitted to the ICU.,TIME SEEN: , Critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient.  I should note that a 12-lead EKG was done here showing sinus bradycardia, normal intervals otherwise.",
4675," Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.", Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Selective Coronary Angiography & Angioplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND INDICATIONS:,  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SUMMARY:,  The patient presented with an acute non-ST-elevation MI.  Despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion.  This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  She has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above.  She will be continued on her medical therapy.  At age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath flushed.  The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  The cath removed, the sheath flushed.,It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI.  The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower.  We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.  Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification.  The stent was removed.  Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  The guidewires and guide cath were removed.  The sheath flushed and sutured into position.  The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.,CONTRAST: , Isovue-370, 120 mL.,FLUORO TIME: , 9.4 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 30 mL.,HEMODYNAMICS:,  Aorta 185/54.,Left ventriculography was not performed.  I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.,The left main is a large vessel, giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels.  The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.,The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  The LAD has significant calcification proximally.  There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  This was not ballooned.  Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent.  Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.,The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.  The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease.,The right coronary was a large, dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small-to-moderate first posterolateral, small second posterolateral, and a small-to-moderate third posterolateral branch.  The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75% stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch.  The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, non-st-elevation mi, selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty, calcified plaque, coronary angiography, st elevation, stenosis, lad, coronary, selective, angiography, angioplasty, balloon, vessel, stent, "

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical site.  The right ankle was then covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  The right foot was prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, all the capsular and periosteal attachments were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right metatarsal.  Once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed, multiple osteophytes were encountered.  Gouty tophi were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint, which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patient.,Using sharp and dull dissection, all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachments were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint was freed from all adhesions.  Using the sagittal saw, all the osteophytes were removed from the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head as well as the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Although some improvement of the range of motion was encountered after the removal of the osteophytes, some tightness and restriction was still present.  The decision was thus made to perform a Youngswick-type osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal.  The osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cuts and a plantar cut in a V-pattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal.  The two dorsal cuts were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The wedge of bone that was formed between the two dorsal cuts was resected and passed off to Pathology for further examination.  The head of the first right metatarsal was then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wires from the OsteoMed System.  The wires were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy.  The wires were also used as guidewires for the insertion of two 16-mm proximally threaded cannulated screws from the OsteoMed System.  The 2 screws were inserted using AO technique.  Upon insertion of the screws, the two wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy on the table was found to be excellent.  The area was copiously flushed with saline and range of motion was reevaluated and was found to be much improved from the preoperative levels without any significant restriction.  The cartilaginous surfaces on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  Steri-Strips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edges.  At this time, the right ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's surgical site was then covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and neurovascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home.  The patient was also given pain medication instructions on how to control her postoperative pain.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.","orthopedic, hallux limitus deformity, metatarsophalangeal joint, plantar cut, youngswick osteotomy, dorsal cuts, ankle tourniquet, proximal phalanx, anesthesia, tourniquet, youngswick, phalanx, metatarsophalangeal, proximal, metatarsal, dorsal, osteotomy"

The patient states that he has had degenerative joint disease in his left first MPJ for many years that has been progressively getting worse and more painful over time.  The patient desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 7 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo-type block.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered to the operating table, the stockinet was reflected, and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.,Attention was then directed to the left first metatarsophalangeal joint.  Approximately a 6 cm dorsomedial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, just medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was undermined medially, off of the joint capsule.  A dorsal linear capsular incision was then made.  Care was taken to identify and preserve the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The capsule and periosteum were then reflected off of the head of the first metatarsal as well as the base of the proximal phalanx.  There was noted to be a significant degenerative joint disease.  There was little to no remaining healthy articular cartilage left on the head of the first metatarsal.  There was significant osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally in the first metatarsal head as well as at the base of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the base of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to ensure that the resection was parallel to the nail.  After the bone was removed in toto, the area was inspected and the flexor tendon was noted to be intact.  The sagittal saw was then used to resect the osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally on the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal was then re-modelled and smoothed in a more rounded position with a reciprocating rasp.  The sizers were then inserted for the Biopro implant.  A large was noted to be of the best size.  There was noted to be some hypertrophic bone laterally in the base of the proximal phalanx.  Following inspection, the sagittal saw was used to clean both the medial and lateral sides of the base.  A small bar drill was then used to pre-drill for the Biopro sizer.  The bone was noted to be significantly hardened.  The sizer was placed and a large Biopro was deemed to be the correct size implant.  The sizer was removed and bar drill was then again used to ream the medullary canal.  The hand reamer with a Biopro set was then used to complete the process.  The Biopro implant was then inserted and tamped with a hammer and rubber mallet to ensure tight fit.  There was noted to be distally increased range of motion after insertion of the implant.,Attention was then directed to the first metatarsal.  A long dorsal arm Austin osteotomy was then created.  A second osteotomy was then created just plantar and parallel to the first osteotomy site.  The wedge was then removed in toto.  The area was feathered to ensure high compression of the osteotomy site.  The head was noted to be in a more plantar flexed position.  The capital fragment was then temporarily fixated with two 0.45 K-wires.  A 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion.  A second more proximal 2.7 x 60 mm screw was also inserted in a standard AO fashion.  With both screws, there was noted to be tight compression at the osteotomy sites.,The K-wires were removed and the areas were then smoothed with reciprocating rash.  A screw driver was then used to check and ensure screw tightness.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Subchondral drilling was performed with a 1.5 drill bit.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Closure consisted of capsular closure with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by running subcuticular stitch of #5-0 Vicryl.  Dressings consisted of Steri-Strips, Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.

The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Using AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections the T11 compression fracture was identified.  Starting from the left side local anesthetic was used for skin wheal just lateral superior to the 10 o'clock position of the lateral aspect of the T11 pedicle on the left.  The 13-gauge needle and trocar were then taken and placed to 10 o'clock position on the pedicle.  At this point using AP and lateral fluoroscopic views, the needle and trocar were advanced into the vertebral body using the fluoroscopic images and making sure that the needle was lateral to the medial wall of the pedicle of the pedicle at all times.  Once the vertebral body was entered then using lateral fluoroscopic views, the needle was advanced to the junction of the anterior one third and posterior two thirds of the body.  At this point polymethylmethacrylate was mixed for 60 seconds.  Once the consistency had hardened and the __________ was gone, incremental dose of the cement were injected into the vertebral body.  It was immediately seen that the cement was going cephalad into the vertebral body and was exiting through the crack in the vertebra.  A total 1.2 cc of cement was injected.  On lateral view, the cement crushed to the right side as well.  There was some dye infiltration into the disk space.  There was no dye taken whatsoever into the posterior aspect of the epidural space or intrathecal canal.,At this point, as the needle was slowly withdrawn under lateral fluoroscopic images, visualization was maintained to ensure that none of the cement was withdrawn posteriorly into the epidural space.  Once the needle was withdrawn safely pressure was held over the site for three minutes.  There were no complications.

A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.", Orthopedic, Total Knee Replacement - 1 ,"PROCEDURES: , Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh.  Sterile prepping and draping proceeded.  The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.  A midline incision was made, centered over the patella.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally.  Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues.  The ACL and PCL were released.  The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed.  These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia.  An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.

The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.,A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component.,At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially.,A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert.,This gave good stability and a full range of motion.,The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component was drilled for.,A further trial reduction was done and two liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement was hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill holes were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone was somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate was secured and the patella was inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement was removed. At this point the tibial baseplate was locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly.,The knee was extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minutes until the cement was cured. Further extraneous cement was removed. The pneumatic tourniquet was released, hemostasis was obtained with electrocoagulation.,Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples.

The patella on the left was not resurfaced.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Degenerative ware of three compartments of the trochlea, the medial, as well as the lateral femoral condyles as well was the plateau.  The surface of the patella was with a minimal ware and minimal osteophytes and we decided not to resurface the patellar component.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 69-year-old male with complaints of bilateral knee pain for several years and increased intensity in the past several months where it has affected his activities of daily living.  He attempted conservative treatment, which includes anti-inflammatory medications as well as cortisone and Synvisc.  This has only provided him with temporary relief.  It is for that reason, he is elected to undergo the above-named procedure.,All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient, which include, but are not limited to infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain.  He has agreed to undergo this procedure and a consent was obtained preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to operating room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/19/03 and was placed supine on the operating room table.  At this time, a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the left extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg.  At this time, a standard midline incision was made towards the total knee.  We did discuss preoperatively for a possible unicompartmental knee replacement for this patient, but he did have radiographic evidence of chondrocalcinosis of the lateral meniscus.  We did start off with a small midline skin incision in case we were going to do a unicompartmental.  Once we exposed the medial parapatellar mini-arthrotomy and visualized the lateral femoral condyle, we decided that this patient would not be an optimal candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement.  It is for this reason that we extended the incision and underwent with the total knee replacement.  Once the full medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed with the subperiosteal dissection of the proximal tibia in order to evert the patella.  Once the patella was everted, we then used a drill to cannulate the distal femoral canal in order to place the intramedullary guide.  A Charnley awl was then used to remove all the intramedullary contents and they were removed from the knee.  At this time, a femoral sizer was then placed with reference to the posterior condyles and we measured a size F. Once this was performed, three degrees of external rotation was then drilled into the condyle in alignment with the epicondyles of the femur.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was then inserted and placed in three degrees of external rotation.  Our anterior cutting guide was then placed and an anterior cut was performed with careful protection of the soft tissues.  Next, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  This was pinned to the distal femur and with careful protection of the collateral ligaments, a distal femoral cut was performed.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was removed and a final cutting block was placed.  This was placed in the center on the distal femur with 1 mm to 2 mm laterally translated for better patellar tracking.  At this time, the block was pinned and screwed in place with spring pins with careful protection of the soft tissues.  An oscillating saw was then used to resect the posterior and anterior cutting blocks with anterior and posterior chamfer as well as the notch cut.  Peg holes were then drilled.,The block was then removed and an osteotome was then used to remove all the bony cut pieces.  At this time with a better exposure of the proximal tibia, we placed external tibial guide.  This was placed with longitudinal axis of the tibia and carefully positioned in order to obtain an optimal cut for the proximal tibia.  At this time with careful soft tissue retraction and protection, an oscillating saw was used to make a proximal tibial osteotomy.  Prior to the osteotomy, the cut was checked with a depth gauge in order to assure appropriate bony resection.  At this time, a _blunt Kocher and Bovie cautery were used to remove the proximal tibial cut, which had soft tissue attachments.  Once this was removed, we then implanted our trial components of size F to the femur and a size 8 mm tibial tray with 12 mm plastic articulating surface.  The knee was taken through range of motion and revealed excellent femorotibial articulation.  The patella did tend to sublux somewhat laterally with extremes of flexion and it was for this reason, we performed a minimal small incision lateral retinacular release.  Distal lateral patella was tracked more uniformly within the patellar groove of the prosthesis.  At this time, an intraoperative x-ray was performed, which revealed excellent alignment with no varus angulation especially of the whole femur and tibial alignment and tibial cut.  At this time, the prosthesis was removed.  A McGill retractor was then reinserted and replaced peg tibial tray in order to peg the proximal tibia.  Once the drill holes were performed, we then copiously irrigated the wound and then suctioned it dry to get ready and prepped for cementation of the drilled components.  At this time, polymethyl methacrylate cement was then mixed.  The cement was placed on the tibial surface as well as the underneath surface of the component.  The component was then placed and impacted with excess cement removed.  In a similar fashion, the femoral component was also placed.  A 12 mm plastic tray was then placed and the leg held in full extension and compression in order to obtain adequate bony cement content.  Once the cement was fully hardened, the knee was flexed and a small osteotome was used to remove any extruding cement from around the prosthesis of the bone.  Once this was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound and the wound was then suctioned dry.  The knee was again taken through range of motion with a 12 mm plastic as well as #14.  The #14 appeared to be a bit too tight especially in extremes of flexion.  We decided to go with a #12 mm polyethylene tray.  At this time, this was placed to the tibial articulation and then left in place.  This was rechecked with careful attention to detail with checking no soft tissue interpositioned between the polyethylene tray and the metal tray of the tibia.  The knee was again taken through range of motion and revealed excellent tracking of the patella with good femur and tibial contact.  A drain was placed and cut to length.,At this time, the knee was irrigated and copiously suction dried.  #1-0 Ethibond suture was then used to approximate the medial parapatellar arthrotomy in figure-of-eight fashion.  A tight capsular closure was performed.  This was reinforced with a #1-0 running Vicryl suture.  At this time, the knee was again taken through range of motion to assure tight capsular closure.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the superficial wound.  #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the wound with figure-of-eight inverted suture.  The skin was then approximated with staples.  The leg was then cleansed.  Sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, and Kerlix roll were then applied.  At this time, the patient was extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good for this patient.","orthopedic, degenerative arthritis, nexgen, polyethylene, cruciate, total knee replacement, proximal tibia, knee replacement, femoral, cutting, tibial, knee, arthritis, femur, cementation, "

She ultimately failed this treatment and developed a collapsing-type valgus degenerative osteoarthritis with complete collapse and ware of the lateral compartment and degenerative changes noted to the femoral sulcus that were proved live.  Medial compartment had minor changes present.  There was no contracture of the lateral collateral ligament, but instead mild laxity on both sides.  There was no significant flexion contracture preoperatively.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was laid supine upon the operating table after receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department.  Thigh tourniquet was placed upon the patient's right leg.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The limb was elevated and exsanguinated and tourniquet placed 325 mmHg for the above noted time.  A straight incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation.  Medial parapatellar arthrotomy was created and the knee cap was everted.  The ligaments were balanced.  A portion of the fat pad was removed and the ACL was completely removed.  Drill hole was made in the distal femur.  The size to an E, right.  Care was taken to make up for the severe loss of articular cartilage on the posterior condyle in the lateral side.  This was checked with the epicondylar abscess and with three degrees of external rotation, drill holes were made.  Intramedullary guide was then placed, pegged, and anterior cut carried out.  There was excellent resection.  It was flat.  Distal cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  Appropriate cuts were carried out.  The standard cut was utilized.,The finishing guide for E was held with pins as well as screws.  Cutting was carried out posterior to anterior, then posterior chamfer and anterior chamfer, femoral sulcus cut was carried out and drill holes for pegs were made.  The cutting guide was then removed.  The bone was removed.  Excess bone was taken out posteriorly.  The posterior capsule was loosened up.  There were two different fabellas in the posterolateral compartment and they were loosened.  Posterolateral corner was then anchored with osteotome and was taken around the posterolateral corner.  An extramedullary tibial cutting guide was then placed, pinned, and held.  A cut was carried out parallel to the foot.  Hard copy ________ was obtained, deemed to be satisfactory after evening up the edges.  Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  It was necessary to perform a lateral retinacular release to the patella.  The patella was isolated.  Approximately 10 mm to 11 mm were reamed off.  The size to 32 mm button and drill hole guide was placed, impacted, and drilled.  Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  The tibial guide was then pinned.  Drill hole was placed, broached, and utilized.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  Methylmethacrylate was mixed and was sequentially placed from the femur to the tibia to the patella.  The implants were sequentially placed in tibia to femur to patella.  Once excess methylmethacrylate was removed and cured, 10 mm Poly was placed.  There was excellent ligament balancing.  A separate portal was utilized for subcutaneous drain.  Tourniquet was deflated and hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation.  Interrupted #1 Ethibond suture was utilized for parapatellar closure, running #1 Vicryl suture was utilized for overstitch.,Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed to the skin.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing.  Digits were pink and warm with brawny pulses distally at the end of the case.  The patient was then transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.","orthopedic, arthroplasty, knee, degenerative osteoarthritis, subcutaneous, osteoarthritis, degenerative, tourniquet, drill,"
2027, Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.  Enlarged dorsal root ganglia of the left L3 nerve root.  Transpedicular decompression of the left L3-L4 with discectomy., Orthopedic, Transpedicular Decompression ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.,2.  Enlarged dorsal root ganglia of the left L3 nerve root.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:, Transpedicular decompression of the left L3-L4 with discectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , None.,HISTORY: , This is a 55-year-old female with a four-month history of left thigh pain.  An MRI of the lumbar spine has demonstrated a mass in the left L3 foramen displacing the nerve root, which appears to be a foraminal disc herniation effacing the L3 nerve root.  Upon exploration of the nerve root, it appears that there was a small disc herniation in the foramen, but more impressive was the abnormal size of the dorsal root ganglia that was enlarged more medially than laterally.  There was no erosion into the bone surrounding the area rather in the pedicle above or below or into the vertebral body, so otherwise the surrounding anatomy is normal.  I was prepared to do a discectomy and had not consented the patient for a biopsy of the nerve root.  But because of the sequela of cutting into a nerve root with residual weakness and persistent pain that the patient would suffer, at this point I was not able to perform this biopsy without prior consent from the patient.  So, surgery ended decompressing the L3 foramen and providing a discectomy with idea that we will obtain contrasted MRIs in the near future and I will discuss the findings with the patient and make further recommendations.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital in a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Endotracheal intubation followed.  The patient received the Foley catheter.  She was then placed in a prone position on a Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  Localizing x-rays were obtained at this time and the back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made over the L3-L4 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissues sharply, dissection was then carried out to the left of the midline with lumbodorsal fascia incised and the musculature was elevated in a supraperiosteal fashion from the level of L3.  Retractors were placed into the wound to retract the musculature.  At this point, the pars interarticularis was identified and the facet joint of L2-L3 was identified.  A marker was placed over the pedicle of L3 and confirmed radiographically.  Next, a microscope was brought onto the field.  The remainder of the procedure was noted with microscopic visualization.  A high-speed drill was used to remove the small portions of the lateral aspects of the pars interarticularis.  At this point, soft tissue was removed with a Kerrison rongeur and the nerve root was clearly identified in the foramen.  As the disc space of L3-L4 is identified, there is a small prominence of the disc, but not as impressive as I would expect on the MRI.  A discectomy was performed at this time removing only small portions of the lateral aspect of the disc.  Next, the nerve root was clearly dissected out and visualized, the lateral aspect of the nerve root appears to be normal in structural appearance.  The medial aspect with the axilla of the nerve root appears to be enlarged.  The color of the tissue was consistent with a nerve root tissue.  There was no identifiable plane and this is a gentle enlargement of the nerve root.  There are no circumscribed lesions or masses that can easily be separated from the nerve root.  As I described in the initial paragraph, since I was not prepared to perform a biopsy on the nerve and the patient had not been consented, I do not think it is reasonable to take the patient to this procedure, because she will have persistent weakness and pain in the leg following this procedure.  So, at this point there is no further decompression.  A nerve fork was passed both ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there was no compression for lateral.  The pedicle was palpated inferiorly and medially and there was no compression, as the nerve root can be easily moved medially.  The wound was then irrigated copiously and suctioned dry.  A concoction of Duramorph and ______ was then placed over the nerve root for pain control.  The retractors were removed at this point.  The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissues with #2 Vicryl sutures, and Steri-Strips covering the incision.  The patient transferred to the hospital gurney, extubated by Anesthesia, and subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.","orthopedic, dorsal root ganglia, nerve root, discectomy, foraminal disc herniation, transpedicular decompression, lateral aspects, disc herniation, nerve, anesthesia, foraminal"
2028," Total hip arthroplasty on the left.  Left hip degenerative arthritis.  Severe degenerative changes within the femoral head as well as the acetabulum, anterior as well as posterior osteophytes.

The patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductors and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis.  This was revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursa.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months.,Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the above-named procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to the Operating Room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/27/03.  The general anesthetic was first performed by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position.  Kidney rests were also used because of the patient's size.  An axillary roll was also inserted for comfort in addition to a Foley catheter, which was inserted by the OR nurse.  All her bony prominences were well padded.  At this time, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  At this time, an anterolateral approach was then performed, first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inches of subcutaneous fat.  The tensor fascia lata was then identified.  A self-retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field.  Bovie cautery was used for hemostasis.  At this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one-third of the greater trochanter.  At this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally.  The tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor.  At this time, after hemostasis was obtained, Bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius.  At this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule.  A ________ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  Once this was performed, Homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  At this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a Bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  At this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum.  At this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  At this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  We made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  At this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut.,The femoral head was then removed.  At this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and Homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum.  A long-handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  With better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  We started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  At the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum.  We then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  A size 54 mm Trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in.  Once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  At this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup.  At this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection.  The leg was then placed back in the bag.  A Bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  A rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  A Box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  A Charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  A power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  At this time, we began broaching.  We started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  Once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  A calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly.  A standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed.  Once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  At this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  This was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening.  Once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  We copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  At this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place.  Once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  The 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the Morse taper assured that this was well fixed by ________.,Next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion.  We were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components.  Copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 Ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter.  Next, a #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  A tight closure was performed.  Since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Staples were then used for skin closure.  The patient's hip was then cleansed.  Sterile dressings consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, ABDs, and foam tape were then placed.  A drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  After the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good.","orthopedic, degenerative arthritis, total hip arthroplasty, tensor fascia lata, vastus lateralis, gluteus medius, femoral neck, femoral head, head, femoral, acetabulum, hip, attachment, arthroplasty,"

", Orthopedic, Total Hip Replacement - 1 ,"PROCEDURE:,  Total hip replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally.  The piriformis and external rotators were identified.  These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule.  The hip was dislocated.  A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating.  The femoral head was removed.  Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum.,Baseline leg-length measurements were taken.  The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed.  Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas.  The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit.  The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction.  Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  The trial liner was placed.,The femur was then flexed and internally rotated.  The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion.  An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal.  Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached.  The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version.  Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement.  Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation.  The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination.  Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability.,The real stem was opened and impacted into position.  The real head was impacted atop the stem.  If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version.  Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component.  Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction.,The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy.  The gluteus maximus was repaired using 0 Ethibond and 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was closed with nylon.

She wishes to proceed with arthroplasty at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the Operative Suite at ABCD General Hospital on 09/11/03.  She was placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered a spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An Esmarch was applied and a tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg on the left thigh.  A longitudinal incision was made over the anterior portion of the knee and this was taken down through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the patella retinaculum.  A medial peripatellar arthrotomy was then made and taken down to the level of the tibial tubercle.  Care was then ensured that the patellar tendon was not violated.  The proximal tibia was then skeletonized both medially and laterally to the level of the axis through the joint line.  Again care was ensured that the patellar tendon was not avulsed from the insertion on the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was then opened using a drill and the anterior sizing guide was then placed.  Rongeur was used to take out any osteophytes and the size of approximately size E. At this point, the epicondyle axis guide was then inserted and aligned in a proper orientation.  The anterior cutting guide was then placed.  Care was checked for the amount of resection that the femur would be notched and the oscillating saw was used to cut the anterior portion of the femur.  After this was performed, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed.  The left knee placed in 5 degrees of valgus, guide was then placed, and a standard distal cut was then taken.  After the cuts were ensured further to be leveled and they were, and we proceeded to place the finishing guide size E and distal femur.  This was placed slightly in lateral position and secured in position with spring tense and head lift tense.  Once adequately secured and placed in the appropriate orientation, the alignment was again verified with the epicondyle axis and appeared to be externally rotated appropriately.  The chamfer cuts and anterior and posterior cuts were then made as well as the notch cut using the reciprocating and oscillating saws.  After this was performed, the guide was removed and all bony fragments were then removed.  Attention was then directed to the tibia.  The external tibial alignment guide was then placed and pinned to the proximal tibia in a proper position.  Care was ensured if it is was a varus or valgus and the appropriate.  The femur gauge was then used to provide us appropriate amount of bony resection.  This was then pinned and secured into place.  Ligament retractors were used to protect the collateral ligaments and the tip proximal tibial cut was then made.  This bony portion was then removed and remaining meniscal fragments were removed as well as the ACL till adequate exposure was obtained.  Trial components were then inserted into position and taken the range of motion and found to have good and full excellent range of motion stability.  The trial components were then removed.  The tibia was then stemmed in standard fashion after the tibial plate was placed in some degree of external rotation with appropriate alignment.  After it was stemmed and broached, these were removed and the patella was then incised, a size 41 patella reamer blade was then used and was taken down, a size 38 patella button was then placed intact.  Again the trial components were placed back into position.  Patella button was placed and the tracking was evaluated.  They tracked centrally with no touch technique.  Again, all components were now removed and the knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Once adequately suctioned dry, the tibial portion was cemented and packed into place.  Also excess cement was removed.  The femoral component was then cemented into position.  All excess cement was removed.  A size 12 poly was then inserted in trial to provide compression at cement adhered.  The patella was then cemented and held into place.  All components were held under compression until cement had adequately adhered all excess cement was then removed.  The knee was then taken through range of motion and size 12 felt to be slightly too big, this was removed and the size 10 trial was replaced, and again had excellent varus and valgus stability with full range of motion and felt to be the articulate surface of choice.  The knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  One last check in the posterior aspect of the knee for any loose bony fragments or osteophytes was performed, there were none found and a final articulating surface was impacted and locked into place.  After this, the knee was taken again for final range of motion and found to have excellent position, stability, and good alignment of the components.  The knee was once again copiously irrigated, and the tourniquet was deflated.  Bovie cautery was used to cauterize the knee bleeding that was seen until good hemostasis obtained.  A drain was then placed deep to the retinaculum and the retinaculum repair was performed using #2-0 Ethibond and oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  This was flexed and the repair was found held securely.  At this point, the knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was approximated with skin staples.  Sterile dressing with Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Kerlix rolls was then applied.  The patient was then transferred back to the gurney in a supine position.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well with no complications, to PACU in satisfactory condition.","orthopedic, degenerative arthritis, nexgen stemmed tibial component, all-poly patella, nexgen cruciate, total knee replacement, patellar tendon, proximal tibia, epicondyle axis, bony fragments, patella button, tibial, knee, arthritis, nexgen, patella"

Preoperative imaging studies revealed the above-noted abnormalities. After a detailed review of management considerations with the patient and his wife, he was elected to proceed as noted above.,Operative indications, methods, potential benefits, risks and alternatives were reviewed. The patient and his wife expressed understanding and consented to proceed as above.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:, L4-L5 and L5-S1 disk protrusion with configuration as anticipated from preoperative imaging studies. Pedicle screw placement appeared satisfactory with satisfactory purchase and positioning noted at all sites as well as satisfactory findings upon probing of the pedicular tracts at each site. In addition, all pedicle screws were stimulated with findings of above threshold noted at all sites. Spacer snugness and positioning appeared satisfactory. Electrophysiological monitoring was carried out throughout the procedure and remained stable with no undue changes reported.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, After obtaining proper patient identification and appropriate preoperative informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology as well as placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team, the patient was carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed as needed. The patient's posterior lumbosacral region was thoroughly cleansed and shaved. The patient was then scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual manner. After local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine solution, a posterior midline skin incision was made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum. Dissection was continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia. Self-retaining retractors were placed and subsequently readjusted as needed. The fascia was opened in the midline, and the standard subperiosteal dissection was then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral elements from L3-L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse processes of L4 and L5 as well as the sacral alae bilaterally. _____ by completing the exposure, pedicle screw fixation was carried out in the following manner. Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion. The pedicle screw entry sites were chosen using standard dorsal landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Cortical openings were created at these sites using a small burr. The pedicular tracts were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder. They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Each site was ""under tapped"" and reprobed with satisfactory findings noted as above. Screws in the following dimensions were placed. 6.5-mm diameter screws were placed at all sites. At S1, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally. At L5, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally, and at L4, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally with findings as noted above. The rod was then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screws on the right. The distraction was placed across the L4-L5 interspace, and the connections were temporarily secured. Using a matchstick burr, a trough was then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from its caudal aspect to its more cranial aspect at the foraminal level. This was longitudinally oriented. A transverse trough was similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the pars against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle. This trough was completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs, and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process was then removed as a unit using rongeurs and curettes. The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process was then removed using a small burr and angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs. A superior laminotomy was performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy was then carried out across this region of decompression, working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally, again using curettes and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization. In this manner, the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space was exposed. Local epidural veins were coagulated with bipolar and divided. Gelfoam was then placed in this area. This process was then repeated in similar fashion; thereby, exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5-S1 disk space. As noted, distraction had previously been placed at L4-L5, this was released. Distraction was placed across the L5-S1 interspace. After completing satisfactory exposure as noted, a annulotomy was made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5-S1 disk space. Intermittent neural retraction was employed with due caution afforded to the neural elements throughout the procedure. The disk space was entered, and diskectomy was carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shavers as well as straight and then angled TLIF curettes to prepare the front plate. Herniated portions of the disk were also removed in routine fashion. The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion. After completing this disk space preparation, Gelfoam was again placed. The decompression was assessed and appeared to be satisfactory. The distraction was released, and attention was redirected at L4-L5, where again, distraction was placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation was carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion. After completing the disk space preparation, attention was redirected to L5-S1. Distraction was released at L4-L5 and again, reapplied at L5-S1, incrementally increasing size. Trial spaces were used, and a 10-mm height by 26-mm length spacer was chosen. A medium BMP kit was appropriately reconstituted. A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft was then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space. The spacer was then carefully impacted into position. The distraction was released. The spacer was checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. This process was then repeated in similar fashion at L4-L5, again with placement of a 10-mm height by 26-mm length Capstone spacer, again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace. This spacer was also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. The prior placement of the spacers and BMP, the wound was thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted. Surgicel was placed over the exposed dura and disk space. The distraction was released on the right and compression plates across the L5-S1 and L4-L5 interspaces and the connections fully tightened in routine fashion. The posterolateral elements on the right from L4 to S1 were prepared for fusion in routine fashion, and BMP sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft was placed in the posterolateral fusion bed as well as the vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the L4-L5 and L5-S1 facets on the right in a routine fashion. A left-sided rod was appropriated contoured and placed to span between the L4 to S1 screws. Again compression was placed across the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, and these connections were fully secured. Thorough hemostasis was ascertained after checking the construct closely and fluoroscopically. The wound was closed using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the deep paraspinal musculature in the midline. The superficial paraspinal musculature in posterior fashion was closed in the midline using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures. The suprafascial subcutaneous layers were closed using multiple simple interrupted #0 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was then closed using staples. Sterile dressings were then applied and secured in place. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","orthopedic, degenerative disk disease, disk protrusions, spondylosis, radiculopathy, tlif, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusio, danek m8, intervertebral prosthetic device, danek capstone, matchstick burr, capstone, bmp, vertebral autograft, screws were placed bilaterally, pedicle screw, kerrison rongeurs, disk space, disk, spacers, kerrison, interbody, rongeurs, pedicle, lumbar, screws, "

This subsequently became infected.  She has undergone removal of this prosthesis and placement of antibiotic spacer.  She currently presents for stage II reconstruction with removal of antibiotic spacer and placement of a revision total hip.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room by anesthesia personnel.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  A Foley catheter was inserted.  A formal time out was obtained in identifying the correct patient, operative site.  Preoperative antibiotics were held for intraoperative cultures.  The patient was placed into the lateral decubitus position with the right side up.  The previous surgical incision was identified.  The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The old surgical incision was reopened along its proximal extent.  Immediately encountered was a large amount of fibrous scar tissue.  Dissection was carried sharply down through this scar tissue.  Soft tissue plains were extremely difficult to visualize due to all the scarring.  There was no native tissue to orient oneself with.  We carried our dissection down through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer.  We incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what was initially felt to be the greater trochanter.  Dissection was carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer was exposed.  This was used as a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection.  The antibiotic spacer was exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur.  Dissection was continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum.  A cobra retractor was able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure.  Once improved visualization was obtained, the antibiotic spacer was removed from the femur.  This allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum.  The acetabulum was filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue.  This was removed with sharp excision with a knife as well as with a rongeur and a Bovie.  Once soft tissue was removed, the acetabulum was reamed.  Reaming was started with a 46-mm reamer and carried up sequentially to prepare for 50-mm shell.  The 50 mm shell was trialed and had good stability and fit.  Attention was then turned to continue preparation of the femur.  The canal was then debrided with femoral canal curettes.  Some fibrous tissue was removed from the canal.  The length of the femoral stem was then checked with this canal curette in place.  Following x-rays, we prepared to begin reaming the femur.  This femur was reamed over a guide rod using flexible reaming rods.  The canal was reamed up to 13.5 mm distally in preparation for 14 mm stem.  The stem was selected and initially size A body was placed in trial.  The body was too tight proximally to fit.  The proximal canal was then reamed for a size AA body.  A longer stem with an anterior bow was selected and a size AA trial was assembled.  This fit nicely in the canal and had good fit and fill.  Intraoperative radiographs were obtained to determine component position.  Intraoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory length of the component past the distal of fractures in the femur.  The remainder of the trial was then assembled and the hip was relocated and trialed.  Initially, it was found to be unstable posteriorly.  We changed from a 10 degree lip liner to 20 degree lip liner.  Again, the hip was trialed and found to be unstable posteriorly.  This was due to reversion of the femoral component.  As we attempted to seat the prosthesis, the stent continued to attempt to turn in retroversion.  The stem was extracted and retrialed.  Improved stability was obtained and we decided to proceed with the real components.  A 20 degree liner was inserted into the acetabular shell.  The real femoral components were assembled and inserted into the femoral canal.  Again, the hip was trialed.  The components were found to be in relative retroversion.  The real components were then backed down and the neck was placed in the more anteversion and reinserted.  Again, the stem attempted to follow in the relative retroversion.  Along with this time, however, it was improved from previous attempts.  The femoral head trial was placed back on the components and the hip relocated.  It was taken to a range of motion and found to have improved stability compared to previous trialing.  Decision was made to accept the component position.  The real femoral head was selected and implanted.  The hip was then taken again to a range of motion.  It was stable at 90 degrees of flexion with 20 degrees of adduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation.  The patient reached full extension and had no instability anteriorly.,The wound was then irrigated again with pulsatile lavage.  Six liters of pulsatile lavage was used during the procedure.,The wound was then closed in a layered fashion.  A Hemovac drain was placed deep to the fascial layer.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 PDS, and staples in the skin.  An incisional VAC was then placed over the wound as well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the close of the case.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient will be weightbearing as tolerated with posterior hip precautions.","orthopedic, infected, bipolar arthroplasty, antibiotic spacer, revision, placement of antibiotic spacer, total hip arthroplasty, scar tissue, soft tissue, antibiotic, spacer, femoral, hip, arthroplasty, total, acetabulum, femur, "

She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg.  She was doing very well and was obviously improving.,The swelling was reduced.  A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination.  She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure.  The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood them well.  All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm.  The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width.  Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided.  The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion.  This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides.  At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present.  Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander.  On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately.  I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor.  I then did place adequate tension on the sutures.  Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller.  At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound.  The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin.  The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors.  The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied.,It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained.  Adequate tension was placed in this region.  A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.","orthopedic, fasciotomy, subcutaneous, muscle, wound debridement, insertion of tissue expander, compartment syndrome, compartment fasciotomy, lateral wound, medial wound, tension controller, tissue expander, wound, tissue, compartment,"

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.  Discharge medication is Darvocet-N 100, 30 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n.  Patient asked to begin gentle active flexion, extension and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery.

The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated.

At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis.  Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  All major neurovascular structures were avoided.  At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.,Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  Compression was noted to be excellent.  All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.,A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing to the right foot.  The patient was given a prescription for pain medications on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was educated on these.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well.  Dr. A was present throughout the entire case.","orthopedic, tailor bunionectomy, weil-type, screw fixation, hallux, abductovalgus, bunion, tailor, deformity, metatarsal, phalangeal, capsulotomy, abductor, hallucis, "

The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size.  The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past.  The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.,The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses.  The foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux.  The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone.  The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx.  There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx.  The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer.  Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen.  At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx.  The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues.  Any suspicious tissue was removed.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe.  A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass.  The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule.  This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance.  It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed.  The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology.  Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC.","orthopedic, distal phalanx, mass, tumor., hallux bone, phalanx, symes amputation, excisional biopsy, distal, amputation, invasion, toe, symes, incision, flushed, excision, tissue, hallux"

Inflammatory synovitis from the volar radial wrist area.,2.  Inflammatory synovitis from the dorsal wrist area.,DRAINS:,  None.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , Patient brought to the operating room.  After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet.  Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder.  A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery.  Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches.  Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery.  Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection.  This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule.  This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window.  After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision.  An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum.  This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment.  EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury.  The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone.  Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified.  This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen.  Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis.  Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer.  Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur.  Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained.  Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided.  Remnants of the scapholunate interosseous which was completely deteriorated were debrided.  The joint capsule was closed anatomically with 4-0 PDS and extensor retinaculum was closed with 4-0 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissues closed with 4-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Steri-Strips were applied to wound edge closure; 10 cc of 0.5% plain Marcaine was infiltrated into the areas of the surgical incisions and radial styloidectomy for postoperative analgesia.

She had undergone a workup with an MRI, which showed no evidence of cord abnormalities.  Therefore, the risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with Surgery with the mother, to include infections, bleeding, nerve injuries, vascular injuries, spinal cord injury with catastrophic loss of motor function and bowel and bladder control.  I also discussed ___________ and need for revision surgery.  The mom understood all this and wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent general anesthetic.  She then had lines placed, and was then placed in a prone position.  Monitoring was then set up, and it was then noted that we could not obtain motor-evoked potentials.  The SSEPs were clear and were compatible with the preoperative, but no preoperative motors had been done, and there was a concern that possibly this could be from the result of the positioning.  It was then determined at that time, that we would go ahead and proceed to wake her up, and make sure she could move her feet.  She was then lightened under anesthesia, and she could indeed dorsiflex and plantarflex her feet, so therefore, it was determined to go ahead and proceed with only monitoring with the SSEPs.,The patient after being prepped and draped sterilely, a midline incision was made, and dissection was carried down.  The dissection utilized a combination of hand instruments and electrocautery and dissected out along the laminae and up to the transverse processes.  This occurred from T2-L2.  Fluoroscopy was brought in to verify positions and levels.  Once this was done, and all bleeding was controlled, retractors were then placed.  Attention was then turned towards placing screws first on the left side.  Lumbar screws were placed at the junction of the transverse process and the facets under fluoroscopic guidance.  The area was opened with a high speed burr, and then the track was defined with a blunt probe, and a ball-tipped feeler was then utilized to verify all walls were intact.  They were then tapped, and then screws were then placed.  This technique was used at L1 and L2, both the right and left.  At T12, a direct straight-ahead technique was utilized, where the facet was removed, and then the position was chosen under the fluoroscopy, and then it was spurred, the track was defined and then probed and tapped, and it was felt to be in good position.  Two screws, in the right and left were placed at T12 as well, reduction screws on the left.  The same technique was used for T11, where right and left screws were placed as well as T10 on the left.  At T9, a screw was placed on the left, and this was a reduction screw.  On the left at T8, a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle.  It was not felt to be intact; therefore, a screw was left out of this.  On the right, a thoracic screw was placed as well as at 7 and 6.  This was the dysmorphic portion of this.  Screws were attempted to be placed up, they could not be placed, so attention was then turned towards placing pedicle hooks.  Pedicle hooks were done by first making a box out of the pedicle, removing the complete pedicle, feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe, and then seating the hook.  Upgoing pedicle hooks were placed at T3, T4, and T5.  A downgoing laminar hook was placed at the T7 level.  Screws had been placed at T6 and T7 on the right.  An upgoing pedicle hook was also placed at T3 on the right, and then, downgoing laminar hooks were placed at T2.  This was done by first using a transverse process, lamina finders to go around the transverse process and then ___________ laminar hooks.  Once all hooks were in place, spinal osteotomies were performed at T7-T8 and T8-T9.  This was the level of the kyphosis, to bring her back out of her kyphoscoliosis.  First the ligamentum flavum was resected using a large Kerrisons.  Next, the laminotomy was performed, and then a Kerrison was used to remove the ligamentum flavum at the level of the facet.  Once this was accomplished, a laminotomy was performed by removing more of the lamina, and to create a small wedge that could be closed down later to correct the kyphosis.  This was then brought out with resection of bone out to the foramen, doing a foraminotomy to free up the foramen on both sides.  This was done also between the T8-T9.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was then placed.  Next, we observed, and measured and contoured.  The rods were then seated on the left, and then a derotation maneuver was performed.  Hooks had come loose, so the rod was removed on the left.  The hooks were then replaced, and the rod was reseated.  Again, it was derotated to give excellent correction.  Hooks were then well seated underneath, and therefore, they were then locked.  A second rod was then chosen on the right, and was measured, contoured, and then seated.  Next, once this was done, the rods were locked in the midsubstance, and then the downgoing pedicle hook, which had been placed at T7 was then helped to compress T8 as was the pedicle screw, and then this compressed the osteotomy sites quite nicely.  Next, distraction was then utilized to further correct at the spine, and to correct on the left, the left concave curve, which gave excellent correction.  On the right, compression was used to bring it down, and then, in the lower lumbar areas, distraction and compression were used to level out L2.  Once this was done, all screws were tightened.  Fluoroscopy was then brought in to verify L1 was level, and the first ribs were also level, and it gave a nice balanced spine.  Everything was copiously irrigated, ___________.  Next, a wake-up test was performed, and the patient was then noted to flex and extend the knees as well as dorsiflex and plantar flex both the feet.  The patient was then again sedated and brought back under general anesthesia.  Next, a high-speed burr was used for decortication.  After final tightening had been accomplished, and then allograft bone and autograft bone were mixed together with 10 mL of iliac crest aspirate and were placed into the wound.  The open canal areas had been protected with Gelfoam.  Once this was accomplished, the deep fascia was closed with multiple figure-of-eight #1's, oversewn with a running #1, _________ were then placed in the subcutaneous spaces which were then closed with 3-0 Vicryl, and then the skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Drains had been placed in the subcutaneous layer x2.  The patient during the case had no changes in the SSEPs, had a normal wake-up test, and had received Ancef and clindamycin during the case.  She was taken from the operating room in good condition.","orthopedic, osteotomy, laminotomy-foraminotomy, sofamor danek, sseps, spinal fusion, transverse processes, pedicle hooks, pedicle, laminotomy, hooks, screws, instrumentation, decompression, scoliosis, sofamor, foraminotomy, spinal"

She has failed conservative measures and sought operative intervention for relief of her symptoms.  For details of workup, please see the dictated operative report.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,Appropriate informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthetic.  She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected.  Second check was made prior to prepping and draping.  Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level.  We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars.  We dissected down carefully to identify the pars.  We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level.  We did this under live fluoroscopy.  We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well.  We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars.  The pars was then drilled out.  We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord.  We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty.  Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further.  Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well.  We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily.  We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material.  We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root.  The Epstein curette removed some more disc material.  Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression.  We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure.  We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure.  Hemostasis was meticulous.  The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl suture for the fascial layer, 2 Vicryl suture for the skin, and Monocryl and Steri-Strips applied.  Dressing was applied.  The patient was awoken from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  150 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION:,  To PACU in stable condition having tolerated the procedure well, to mobilize routinely when she is comfortable to go to her home.","orthopedic, thoracic right-sided discectomy, herniated nucleus pulposus, discectomy, thoracic, herniated,"

At the last time, there was gross purulence that was encountered.  Since that time, the patient has defervesced.  Her white count is slowly coming down.  Her C-reactive protein is slowly coming down.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, operative site marked, and after preoperative antibiotics were given, the patient was brought back to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table, where Anesthesia induced general anesthesia.  The patient's right lower extremity was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Surgical timeout occurred verifying the patient's identification, surgical site, surgical procedure, and administration of antibiotics.  The patient's previous incision sites had the sutures removed.  We bluntly dissected down through to the IT band.  These deep stitches were then removed.  We exposed the area of the subperiosteal abscess.  The tissue looked much better than at the last surgery.  We irrigated this area with three liters of saline containing bacitracin.  Next, we made our small medial window to assist with washout of the joint itself.  We put another three liters of saline containing bacitracin through the knee joint.  Lastly, we did another three liters into the area of the distal femur with three liters of plain saline.  We then placed two Hemovac drains, one in the metaphysis and one superficially.  We closed the deep fascia with #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous layers with 2-0 Monocryl and closed the skin with 2-0 nylon.  We placed a sterile dressing.  We then turned the case over to Dr. Petty for dressing change and skin graft.,PLAN:  ,Our plan will be to pull the drains in 48 hours.

Posterior spine segmental instrumentation from T3-L5, placement of morcellized autograft and allograft.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a severe scoliosis.  This was found to be moderately corrected.  Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy.,INDICATIONS: , The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate lines were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed as well.,He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed.  The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later.,The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This was over 5 levels.  Disks and endplates were then removed.  Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well.  Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl.  This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape.,The patient was then rotated into a prone position.  The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.,Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned.  This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side.  The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This was done using pulsed lavage.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed.  The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.  All instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.,The patient will be managed in the ICU and then on the floor as indicated.","orthopedic, anterior spine fusion, posterior spine fusion, spine segmental instrumentation, dry sterile dressings, autograft and allograft, pds sutures, spinous processes, spine fusion, spine, instrumentation, morcellized, allograft, fusion, autograft, "
2049, Superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion repair., Orthopedic, Superior Labrum Lesions Repair ,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified.  The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given anesthetic.,Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed.  It revealed no patholigamentous laxity.  We then placed the patient into a beach-chair position, maintaining a neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax.  The shoulder was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  We then injected the glenohumeral joint with 60 cc of sterile saline solution.  A small stab incision was made 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion.  Through this incision, a blunt trocar was placed.,We then placed the camera through this cannula and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline solution.  An anterior portal was made just below the subscapularis and then we began to inspect the shoulder joint.,We found that the articular surface was in good condition.  The biceps was found to be intact.  There was a SLAP tear noted just posterior to the biceps.  Pictures were taken.  No Bankart or Hill-Sachs lesions were noted.  The rotator cuff was examined and there were no undersurface tears.  Pictures were again taken.,We then made a lateral portal going through the muscle belly of the rotator cuff.  A drill hole was made and then knotless suture anchor was placed to repair this.  Pictures were taken.  We then washed out the joint with copious amounts of sterile saline solution.  It was drained.  Our 3 incisions were closed using 3-0 nylon suture.  A pain pump catheter was introduced into the shoulder joint.  Xeroform, 4 x 4s, ABDs, tape, and sling were placed.,The patient was successfully taken out of the beach-chair position, extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.  I then went out and spoke with the patient's family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care.","orthopedic, laxity, patholigamentous, superior labrum, saline solution, anterior, superior, lesions, repair, sterile, joint, shoulder,"
2050," Spinal Manipulation under Anesthesia - Sacro-iliitis, lumbo-sacral segmental dysfunction, thoraco-lumbar segmental dysfunction, associated with myalgia/fibromyositis.", Orthopedic, Spinal Manipulation ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Sacro-iliitis (720.2), lumbo-sacral segmental dysfunction (739.3), thoraco-lumbar segmental dysfunction (739.2), associated with myalgia/fibromyositis (729.1).,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Sacro-iliitis (720.2), lumbo-sacral segmental dysfunction (739.3), thoraco-lumbar segmental dysfunction (739.2), associated with myalgia/fibromyositis (729.1).,ANESTHESIA: , Conscious Sedation.,INFORMED CONSENT: , After adequate explanation of the medical surgical and procedural options, this patient has decided to proceed with the recommended spinal Manipulation under Anesthesia (MUA).  The patient has been informed that more than one procedure may be necessary to achieve the satisfactory results.,INDICATION:,  This patient has failed extended conservative care of condition/dysfunction by means of aggressive physical medical and pharmacological intervention.,COMMENTS: , This patient understands the essence of the diagnosis and the reasons for the MUA- The associated risks of the procedure, including anesthesia complications, fracture, vascular accidents, disc herniation and post-procedure discomfort, were thoroughly discussed with the patient.  Alternatives to the procedure, including the course of the condition without MUA, were discussed.  The patient understands the chances of success from undergoing MUA and that no guarantees are made or implied regarding outcome.  The patient has given both verbal and written informed consent for the listed procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was draped in the appropriate gowning and accompanied to the operative area.  Following their sacral block injection, they were asked to lie supine on the operative table and they were placed on the appropriate monitors for this procedure.  When the patient and I were ready, the anesthesiologist administered the appropriate medications to assist the patient into the twilight sedation using medication which allows the stretching, mobilization, and adjustments necessary for the completion of the outcome I desired.,THORACIC SPINE: , With the patient in the supine position on the operative table, the upper extremities were flexed at the elbow and crossed over the patient's chest to achieve maximum traction to the patient's thoracic spine.  The first assistant held the patient's arms in the proper position and assisted in rolling the patient for the adjusting procedure.  With the help of the first assist, the patient was rolled to their right side, selection was made for the contact point and the patient was rolled back over the doctor's hand.  The elastic barrier of resistance was found, and a low velocity thrust was achieved using a specific closed reduction anterior to posterior/superior manipulative procedure.  The procedure was completed at the level of TI-TI2.  Cavitation was achieved.,LUMBAR SPINE/SACRO-ILIAC JOINTS:,  With the patient supine on the procedure table, the primary physician addressed the patient's lower extremities which were elevated alternatively in a straight leg raising manner to approximately 90 degrees from the horizontal.  Linear force was used to increase the hip flexion gradually during this maneuver.  Simultaneously, the first assist physician applied a myofascial release technique to the calf and posterior thigh musculature.  Each lower extremity was independently bent at the knee and tractioned cephalad in a neutral sagittal plane, lateral oblique cephalad traction, and medial oblique cephalad traction maneuver.  The primary physician then approximated the opposite single knee from his position from neutral to medial slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. (a piriformis myofascial release was accomplished at this time).  This was repeated with the opposite lower extremity.  Following this, a Patrick-Fabere maneuver was performed up to and slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance.,With the assisting physician stabling the pelvis and femoral head (as necessary), the primary physician extended the right lower extremity in the sagittal plane, and while applying controlled traction gradually stretched the para-articular holding elements of the right hip by means gradually describing an approximately 30-35 degree horizontal arc.  The lower extremity was then tractioned, and straight caudal and internal rotation was accomplished.  Using traction, the lower extremity was gradually stretched into a horizontal arch to approximately 30 degrees.  This procedure was then repeated using external rotation to stretch the para-articular holding elements of the hips bilaterally.  These procedures were then repeated on the opposite lower extremity.,By approximating the patient's knees to the abdomen in a knee-chest fashion (ankles crossed), the lumbo-pelvic musculature was stretched in the sagittal plane, by both the primary and first assist, contacting the base of the sacrum and raising the lower torso cephalad, resulting in passive flexion of the entire lumbar spine and its holding elements beyond the elastic barrier of resistance","orthopedic, fibromyositis, myalgia, segmental dysfunction, sacro-iliitis, spinal manipulation under anesthesia, lumbar segmental dysfunction, informed consent, iliac joints, spinal manipulation, sacro iliitis, lower extremity, spinal, mua, cephalad, dysfunction, segmental, lumbar, "

Sixty-percent rotator cuff tear, joint side.,2.  Impingement syndrome.,ANESTHESIA: , General,NAME OF OPERATION:,1.  Arthroscopic subacromial decompression.,2.  Repair of rotator cuff through mini-arthrotomy.,FINDINGS AT OPERATION: , The patient's glenohumeral joint was completely clear, other than obvious tear of the rotator cuff.  The midportion of this appeared to be complete, but for the most part, this was about a 60% rupture of the tendon.  This was confirmed later when the bursal side was opened up.  Note, the patient also had abrasion of the coracoacromial ligament under the anterolateral edge of the acromion.  He did not have any acromioclavicular joint pain or acromioclavicular joint disease noted.,PROCEDURE:,  He was given an anesthetic, examined, prepped, and draped in a sterile fashion in a beach-chair position.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  Arthroscopy was then carried out in standard fashion using a 30-degree Dionic scope.  With the scope in the posterior portal, the above findings were noted, and an anterior portal was established.  A curved shaver was placed for debridement of the tear.  I established this was about a 60-70% tear with a probable complete area of tear which was very small.  There were no problems at the biceps or the rest of the joint.  The subacromial space showed findings, as noted above, and a thorough subacromial decompression was carried out with a Bovie, rotary shaver, and bur.  I did not debride the acromioclavicular joint.  The lateral portal was then extended to a mini-arthrotomy, and subacromial space was entered by blunt dissection through the deltoid.  The area of weakness of the tendon was found, and was transversely cut, and findings were confirmed.  The diseased tissue was removed, and the greater tuberosity was abraded with a rongeur.  Tendon-to-tendon repair was then carried out with buried sutures of 2-0 Ethibond, giving a very nice repair.  The shoulder was carried through a range of motion.  I could see no evidence of impingement.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  The deltoid deep fascia was anatomically closed, as was the superficial fascia.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed in layers.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well.","orthopedic, rotator cuff tear, mini-arthrotomy, repair of rotator cuff, arthroscopic subacromial decompression, arthroscopic subacromial, cuff tear, subacromial space, subacromial decompression, mini arthrotomy, acromioclavicular joint, rotator cuff, arthroscopic, decompression, acromioclavicular, impingement, rotator, cuff,"

Physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.", Orthopedic, Rotator Cuff Tear ,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup left-sided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity C6 radiculopathy.  I had last seen her on 06/21/07.,At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy.  She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07.  At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI.  I did not have any recent images.  I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.,She states that her symptoms are unchanged.  She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y.,She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist.  She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note.  No significant right upper extremity symptoms.  No bowel, bladder dysfunction.  No difficulty with ambulation.,FINDINGS: , On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities.  Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus.  Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally.  Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities.  Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder.,An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity.,Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed.  It is relatively limited study due to artifact.  He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change.  There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.,I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery.  With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with.  I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections.  The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.,I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine.,I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks.","orthopedic, upper extremity, radiculopathy, rotator cuff repair, cervical spinal stenosis, rotator cuff tear, physical examination, cuff, impingement, stenosis, extremity, surgery, tear, shoulder, rotator, cervical,"

Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot., Orthopedic, Scarf Bunionectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Scarf bunionectomy procedure of the first metatarsal of the left foot.,ANESTHESIA:,  IV sedation with local.,HISTORY: , This patient is a 55-year-old female who presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery for her painful left bunion.  The patient has had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoes.  The patient has failed to conservative treatment and desires surgical correction at this time.  Risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail by Dr. X, and consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously.  The patient was then taken to the Operating Suite via cart and was placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for protection.  Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over her left ankle with copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was applied, the patient was given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 4.5 cc 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1.0 cc of Solu-Medrol mixture in the standard Mayo block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was then elevated, the Esmarch was applied and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then lowered to the operating field.,A sterile stockinet was reflected and the attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  After sufficient anesthesia, using a #10 blade a linear incision was made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally, just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, this incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing veins were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery.  A neurovascular bundle was identified and reflected medially.  Laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and protected with retraction as well.  Care was then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margins of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully.  The first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule was then identified and using a #15 blade, a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule.  The periosteum was reflected and elevated off of its bone and the metatarsal head as well as the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree.  Noted was a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head as well as some small osteophytes along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx.  Care was then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  The bone cortex was noted to be intact and in good condition.  Following this, using a sagittal saw with a #138 blade, the attention was directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head.  In the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial, the medial eminence of bone was resected.  Plantarly it was noted that the tibial sesamoid groove was intact and the sesamoid apparatus was intact as well.  Following this bone cut, 0.45 K-wire was inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head.  Then using the Reese osteotomy guide, the guide was directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal.  A second 0.45 K-wire was inserted proximally as well.  Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral.  After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made.  This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone.  Following this, the distal portion of the osteotomy cut was freely movable and was able to be translocated medially.  The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone.  Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction.  Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit.  The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex.  Then using 2.7 mm tap, the thread holes were placed and using an 18 x 2.7 mm screw ___________ was achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved.  Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked.  Following this, the holes were measured, found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole was tapped using a 2.7 mm tap.  Following this, a 20 mm full threaded screw was inserted and tightened.  Good intramedullary sludge was noted and compression was achieved.  Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite.  Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted.  Based on this, a lateral release was performed.  The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace.  The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected.  Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament.  Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment.  The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline.  After this, attention was directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed and the capsule was closed using #3-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were closed using #3-0 and #4-0 Vicryl sutures to close in layers.  The skin was then reapproximated and closed using #5-0 Monocryl suture.  Following this, the incisions were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Kerlix as well as Coban dressing.  The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minutes at 250 mmHg.  The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  Following this, the patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen total #20 to be taken one every six hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four times a day.  The patient was given surgical shoe and was placed in a posterior sling.  The patient was given crutches and instructed to use them for ambulation.  The patient was instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend.  The patient will follow up with Dr. X on Tuesday morning at 11'o clock in his Livonia office.  The patient was concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and was placed on codeine and antibiotics due to that.  The patient has Dr. X's pager and will contact him over this weekend if she has any problems or complaints or return to Emergency Department if any difficulty should arise.  X-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home upon completion of this.","orthopedic, hallux abductovalgus deformity, scarf bunionectomy, metatarsal, bunion, hallux abductovalgus, metatarsophalangeal joint, dorsally, foot, bone, abductovalgus "

The patient was taken to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old female who has had increased pain in to her right shoulder.  X-rays as well as an MRI showed a severe arthritic presentation of the humeral head with mild arthrosis of the glenoid.  She had an intact rotator cuff being at a young age and with potential of glenoid thus it was felt that a hemi-resurfacing was appropriate for her right shoulder focusing in the humeral head.  All risks, benefits, expectations and complications of surgery were explained to her in detail including nerve and vessel damage, infection, potential for hardware failure, the need for revision surgery with potential of some problems even with surgical intervention.  The patient still wanted to proceed forward with surgical intervention.  The patient did receive 1 g of Ancef preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operating table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was moved to a beach chair position.  All extremities were well padded.  Her head was well padded to the table.  Her right upper extremity was draped in sterile fashion.  A saber incision was made from the coracoid down to the axilla.  Skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the cephalic vein was retracted as well as all neurovascular structures were retracted in the case.  Dissecting through the deltopectoral groove, the subscapularis tendon was found as well as the bicipital tendon, 1 finger breadth medial to the bicipital tendon an incision was made.  Subscapularis tendon was released.  The humeral head was brought in to; there were large osteophytes that were removed with an osteotome.  The glenoid then was evaluated and noted to just have mild arthrosis, but there was no need for surgical intervention in this region.  A sizer was placed.  It was felt that size 5 was appropriate for this patient, after which the guide was used to place the stem and pin.  This was placed, after which a reamer was placed along the humeral head and reamed to a size 5.  All extra osteophytes were excised.  The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were intact.  Next, the excess bone was removed and irrigated after which reaming of the central portion of the humeral head was performed of which a trial was placed and showed that there was adequate fit and appropriate fixation.  The arm had excellent range of motion.  There are no signs of gross dislocation.

Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position.  Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel.,At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue.  Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis.  Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized.  At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated.  There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable.  There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted.  The articular surface could be visualized.  The biceps tendon was intact.  There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface.  The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well.  At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture.  It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure.  The capsule was also reflected posterior.  At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized.  It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact.  The humeral head was evaluated.  There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head.  At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head.  The arm was adequately positioned.  An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut.  This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck.  This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed.  At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized.  The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10.  Under direct visualization, this was performed easily.  At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins.  This was then removed.  A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured.  It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement.  At this point, the trial component was removed.  Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut.  The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization.  All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself.  This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point.  The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced.,The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion.  Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular.  The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity.  This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear.  This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire.  After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition.","orthopedic, glenohumeral rotator cuff, arthroscopy, degenerative joint disease, shoulder hemiarthroplasty, rotator, cuff, subscapular, shoulder, "

Post-fixation x-rays, nonalignment, no new changes.  Post-fixation neurologic examination normal.,CLINICAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 41-year-old female who presented to me with severe cervical spondylosis and myelopathy.  She was referred to me by Dr. X.  The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate.  Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days.  She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities.  No airway issues.  It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.,I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.,During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.,Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.  X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes.,The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on.,The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days.  Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery.  She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course.,The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family.","orthopedic, cervical spondylosis, anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression, fusion, pmt, crown, vest, pmt halo, cervical,"
2064, A sample note on RICE Therapy, Orthopedic, RICE Therapy ,"RICE, stands for the most important elements of treatment for many injuries---rest, ice, compression, and elevation.,REST:,Stop using the injured part as soon as you realize that an injury has taken place. Use crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the foot, ankle, knee, or leg. Use splints for injuries of the hand, wrist, elbow, or arm. Continued exercise or activity could cause further injury, increased pain, or a delay in healing.,ICE:,Ice helps stop bleeding from injured blood vessels and capillaries. Sudden cold causes the small blood vessels to contract. This contraction decreases the amount of blood that can collect around the wound. The more blood that collects, the longer the healing time. Ice can be safely applied in many ways:,*  For injuries to small areas, such as a finger, toe, foot, or wrist, immerse the injured area for 15 to 35 minutes in a bucket of ice water. Use ice cubes to keep the water cold, adding more as the ice cubes dissolve.,*  For injuries to larger areas, use ice packs. Avoid placing the ice directly on the skin. Before applying the ice, place a towel, cloth, or one or two layers of an elasticized compression bandage on the skin to be iced. To make the ice pack, put ice chips or ice cubes in a plastic bag or wrap them in a thin towel. Place the ice pack over the cloth. The pack may sit directly on the injured part, or it may be wrapped in place.,*  Ice the injured area for about 30 minutes.,*  Remove the ice to allow the skin to warm for 15 minutes.,*  Reapply the ice.,*  Repeat the icing and warming cycles for 3 hours. Follow the instructions below for compression and elevation. If pain and swelling persist after 3 hours call our office. You may need to change the icing schedule after the first 3 hours. Regular ice treatment is often discontinued after 24 to 48 hours. At that point, heat is sometimes more comfortable.,COMPRESSION:,Compression decreases swelling by slowing bleeding and limiting the accumulation of blood and plasma near the injured site. Without compression, fluid from adjacent normal tissue seeps into the injured area. To apply compression safely to an injury:,*  Use an elasticized bandage (Ace bandage) for compression, if possible. If you do not have one available, any kind of cloth will suffice for a short time.,*  Wrap the injured part firmly, wrapping over the ice. Begin wrapping below the injury site and extend above the injury site.,*  Be careful not to compress the area so tightly that the blood supply is impaired. Signs of deprivation of the blood supply include pain, numbness, cramping, and blue or dusky nails. Remove the compression bandage immediately if any of theses symptoms appears. Leave the bandage off until all signs of impaired circulation disappear. Then rewrap the area--less tightly this time.,ELEVATION:,Elevating the injured part above the level of the heart is another way to decrease swelling and pain at the injury site. Elevate the iced, compressed area in whatever way is most convenient. Prop an injured leg on a solid object or pillows. Elevate an injured arm by lying down and placing pillows under the arm or on the chest with the arm folded across.","orthopedic, rest, ice, compression, and elevation, foot, ankle, knee, leg, splints, hand, wrist, elbow, arm, ace bandage, compression and elevation, rice therapy, compression bandage, ice packs, rice, elevation, swelling, bandage, therapy"

The patient was seen in the emergency room.  The patient had a complete fracture of both bones with shortening bayonet apposition.  Treatment options were offered to the family including casting versus closed reduction and pinning.  The parents opted for the latter.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery included risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, cast tightness.  All questions were answered, and the parents agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A small incision was made at the tip of the olecranon.  Initially, a 1.11 guidewire was placed, but this was noted to be too wide for this canal.  This was changed for a 0.79 K-wire.  This was driven up to the fracture site.  The fracture was manually reduced and then the K-wire passed through the distal segment.  This demonstrated adequate fixation and reduction of both bones.  The pin was then cut short.  The fracture site and pin site was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine.  The incision was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The wounds were cleaned and dried.  Dressed with Xeroform, 4 x 4.  The patient was then placed in a well-moulded long-arm cast.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was subsequently taken to Recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be maintain current pin, and long-arm cast for 4 weeks at which time he will return for cast removal.  X-rays of the right forearm will be taken.  The patient may need additional mobilization time.  Once the fracture has healed, we will take the pin out, usually at the earliest 3 to 4 months.  Intraoperative findings were relayed to the parents.  All questions were answered.","orthopedic, closed reduction, pinning, forearm refracture, fracture site, arm cast,"

I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,PROCEDURE: , Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.,The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.,With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.,The following technique was used to confirm correct placement.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration.  No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts.  Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue.

The patient suffered a fracture of a distal tibia and fibula as well as her great toe on the left side at that time.  The patient was evaluated by the emergency room and did undergo further evaluation due to loss of consciousness.  She underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the Medicine Service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention.  Due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation.  The patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome.  Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband.  All questions were answered, and consent was obtained.  The risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery.,FINDINGS:,1.  There was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture.  Following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length.,2.  The base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement.  As the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed.,3.  Her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area.  The left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient.  She was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team.  She received Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics.  When all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  At this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site.  A single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 Schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able.  When this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture.  Attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive.  X-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture.  At this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends.  The stab wounds for the Schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with Betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition.  Please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case.,PLAN:  ,The patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication.  She will maintain her buddy taping in regards to her great toe fracture.","orthopedic, phalanx fracture, schantz pins, toe fracture, tibia fracture, pilon fracture, external fixation, proximal phalanx, fracture, toe, pilon, phalanx, reduction, tibia, proximal, fixation, "

She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A small bump was placed underneath her right buttock.  The right upper thigh was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The upper aspect of the incision was reincised.  The dissection was carried down to the crew, which was easily found.  A guidewire was placed inside the screw with subsequent removal of the previous screw.  The previous screw measured 65 mm.  A 60 mm screw was then placed under direct visualization with fluoroscopy.  The hip was taken through full range of motion to check on the length of the screw, which demonstrated no intraarticular protrusion.  The guidewire was removed.  The wound was then irrigated and closed using 2-0 Vicryl in the fascial layer as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and tape.  The area was infiltrated with total 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery.  She should continue toe touch weightbearing on her leg.  The wound may be wet in approximately 5 days.  The patient should follow up in clinic in about 10 days.  The patient is given Vicodin for pain.  Intraoperative findings were relayed to the mother.","orthopedic, guidewire, capital femoral epiphysis, intraarticular protrusion, femoral epiphysis, pinning, screw,"

Osteomyelitis, right hallux.", Orthopedic, Phalanx Amputation ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Osteomyelitis, right hallux.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, right hallux.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Amputation distal phalanx and partial proximal phalanx, right hallux.,ANESTHESIA:,  TIVA/local.,HISTORY:,  This 44-year-old male patient was admitted to ABCD General Hospital on 09/02/2003 with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the right hallux and cellulitis of the right lower extremity.  The patient has a history of diabetes and has had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and has been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed.  The patient after a multiple conservative treatments such as wound care antibiotics, the patient was given the option of amputation as a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis.  The patient desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent was available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap was placed across his waist.  Adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux as a digital block.  The foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.,Attention was directed to the hallux where there was a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There was a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the sides of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe was 2.5 times to the normal size.  There were superficial ulcerations in the medial arch of both feet secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade was used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision was carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx was disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe was amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity as well as tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx was inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion as suspected.  Therefore, a sagittal saw was used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was also sent off for culture and was labeled proximal margin.  Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon was identified and retracted as far as possible distally and transected.  The flexor tendon distally was gray discolored and was not viable.  A hemostat was used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally.  None was found.  No purulent drainage or abscess was found.  The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue was viable and healthy.  There was no malodor.  Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and passed this as a specimen to microbiology.  Next, copious amounts of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound.,A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension.  The plantar flap was viable and was debulked with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flap was folded dorsally and reapproximated carefully with #3-0 nylon with a combination of simple interrupted and vertical mattress sutures.  Iris scissors were used to modify and remodel the plantar flap.  An excellent cosmetic result was achieved.  No tourniquet was used in this case.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and surgery without apparent complications.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient was transported via cart to Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs able and vascular status intact to right foot.  He will be readmitted to Dr. Katzman where we will continue to monitor his blood pressure and regulate his medications.  Plan is to continue the antibiotics until further IV recommendations.,He will be nonweightbearing to the right foot and use crutches.  He will elevate his right foot and rest the foot, keep it clean and dry.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday of next week.","orthopedic, osteomyelitis, phalanx, phalanx amputation, proximal margin, plantar flap, distal phalanx, proximal phalanx, proximal, hallux, amputation, foot, plantarly, distal"

The patient presented with mild bruising over the proximal arm of the right side with x-ray showing no fracture.  Over concerns for pectoralis tendon tear, he was sent for MRI evaluation where a complete rupture of a portion of the pectoralis major tendon was noted.  Due to the patient's young age and active lifestyle surgical treatment was recommended in order to obtain best result.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient including, but not limited to scarring, infection, damage to blood vessels and nerves, re-rupture, need further surgery, loss of range of motion, inability to return to heavy activity such as weight lifting, complex usual pain syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis as well as anesthetic risks.  Understanding all risks and benefits, the patient desires to proceed with surgery as planned.,FINDINGS:,1.  Following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder, the pectoralis major tendon was encountered.  The clavicular head was noted to be intact.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an oblique-type tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion.,2.  Following freeing of adhesions using tracks and sutures, the pectoralis major tendon was able to reapproximated to its insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps.,3.  A soft tissue repair was performed with #5 FiberWire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site.  Following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor, there was noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edges and a solid repair.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: , The patient was identified in the preop holding area.  His right shoulder was identified, marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient.  He was then taken to the operating room where he was transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team.  He then received prophylactic antibiotics.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, surgery performed, administration of antibiotics, and the availability of equipment.  At this point, the patient was placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure points were padded and there was no pressure over the eyes.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative markings were still visible at this point.  A deltopectoral incision was made utilizing the inferior portion.  Dissection was carried down.  The deltoid was retracted laterally.  The clavicular head of the pectoralis major was noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion.  There was a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head.  Gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion, traction sutures of #5 Ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion.  This allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump.  At this point, a repair using #5 FiberWire was then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edges and no gapping of the repair site.  At this point, a single metal suture anchor was attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site; however, the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone.  For this reason, the starting hole was tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed, doubly loaded.  The sutures were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified Krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair.  At this point, there was noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue ends and a solid repair to gentle manipulation.  Aggressive external rotation was not performed.  The wound was then copiously irrigated.  The cephalic vein was not injured during the case.  The skin was then closed using a 2-0 Vicryl followed by a 3-0 subcuticular Prolene suture with Steri-Strips.  Sterile dressing was then placed.  Anesthesia was then performed, interscalene block.  The patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotated.,Plan for this patient, the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 days.  We will then start a gentle Codman type exercises and having limited motion until the 4-6 week point based on the patient's progression.","orthopedic, tendon rupture, interscalene block, pectoralis major tendon rupture, pectoralis major tendon, repair, pectoralis, interscalene, tendon, rupture, sutures,"

2081, Pain management sample progress note., Orthopedic, Pain Management Progress Note ,"DIAGNOSES:,1.  Cervical dystonia.,2.  Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome.,Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side.  She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.

Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx, right foot.,ANESTHESIA:,Local infiltrate with IV sedation.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems.  The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options.,The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail.  The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE #1: , Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head.  The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound.,Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition.  The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition.  An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration.  Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove.  The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp.,Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment.  The access guide was noted to be in good position.  A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed.  The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal.  The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head.  The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal.,Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment.  It was then fixated with 1 screw.  A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction.  The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position.  Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory.  Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site.  Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally.  All rough edges were rasped smooth.  Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux.  A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated., ,PROCEDURE #2:,  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux.  The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint.  All vital structures were identified and retracted.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface.  The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux.  Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected.  The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.,Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site.  The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved.  The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips.,Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time.,A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient should wear it when walking or standing., ,The next office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions.  The patient was discharged home with vital signs stable in no acute distress.", 
2083, Pain management for post-laminectomy low back syndrome and radiculopathy.  , Orthopedic, Pain Management Consult - 1 ,"Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck.  The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer.  He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember.  He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005.  At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2.  This was done on 12/15/2005.  Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required.  He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal.  The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center.  At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations.  He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis.  This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist.  It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs.  Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time.  In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program.  The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  Evaluation was done by Dr. B.  At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco.  These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited.  He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero.  The patient denies smoking at this time.  He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  He obtains no pain medications from no other sources.  Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.  There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient does not know what medications he is taking for diabetes and denies any diabetes.  CABG in July of 2006 with no preoperative angina, shortness of breath, or myocardial infarction.  History of depression, lumbar fusion surgery in 2000, left knee surgery 25 years ago.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is on disability.  He does not smoke.  He does not drink alcohol.  He is single.

In addition, she complains of a painful right talus bunion to the right foot.  She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes and serial debridement and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time she desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After IV was established by the Department Of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart.  She was placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for retraction.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied around the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied.,Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department Of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine/4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine/1 cc of Kenalog was injected into the right foot in an infiltrative type block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  Next, the foot was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the dorsal third metatarsal area.  There was a plantar hyperkeratotic lesion and a plantar flex palpable third metatarsal head.  A previous cicatrix was noted with slight hypertrophic scarring.  Using a #10 blade, a lazy S-type incision was created over the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal, approximately 3.5 cm in length.  Two semi-elliptical converging incisions were made over the hypertrophic scar and it was removed and passed off as a specimen.  Next, the #15 blade was used to deepen the incision down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small traversing veins were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a combination of blunt and sharp dissection were used to undermine the long extensor tendon, which was tacked down with a moderate amount of fibrosis and fibrotic scar tissue.  Next, the extensor tendon was retracted laterally and the deep fascia over the metatarsals was identified.  A linear incision down to bone was made with a #15 blade to the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated using a sharp dissection with a #15 blade, off of the third metatarsal.  McGlamry elevator was carefully inserted around the head of the metatarsal and freed and all the plantar adhesions were freed.  A moderate amount of plantar adhesions were encountered.  The third toe was plantar flex and the third metatarsal was delivered into the wound.  Next, a V-shaped osteotomy with an apex distally was created using a sagittal saw.  The metatarsal head was allowed to float.  The wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues, which kept the metatarsal head contained.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.,Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal.  There was a large palpable hypertrophic prominence, which is the area of maximal pain, which the patient complained of preoperatively.  A #10 blade was used to make a 3 cm incision through the skin.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects were undermined.  The abductor tendon was identified and retracted.  A capsuloperiosteal incision was made with a #15 blade in a linear fashion down to the bone.  The capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade.,Next, the sagittal saw was used to resect the large hypertrophic dorsal exostosis.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The wound was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  #4-0 Vicryl was used to close subcutaneous layer with a simple interrupted suture.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal where a bursal sac was felt to be palpated under the plantar flex third metatarsal head.  A #15 blade was used to make a small linear incision under the third metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened through the dermal layer and curved hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors were used to undermine the skin from the underlying bursa.  The wound was flushed and two simple interrupted sutures with #4-0 nylon were applied.,Standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,A sterile stockinet was placed on the toes just below the knee.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on all bony prominences.  3 inch and 4 inch fiberglass cast tape was used to create a below the knee well-padded, well-moulded cast.  One was able to insert two fingers to the distal and proximal aspects of the _cast.  The capillary refill time to the digits was less than three seconds after cast application.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedures without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She was given standard postoperative instructions to rest, ice and elevate her right foot.  She was counseled on smoking cessation.  She was given Vicoprofen #30 1 p.o. q.4-6h p.r.n., pain.  She was given Keflex #30 1 p.o. t.i.d.  She is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday.  She is to be full weightbearing with a cast boot.

1505, Transesophageal Echocardiogram.  A woman admitted to the hospital with a large right MCA CVA causing a left-sided neurological deficit incidentally found to have atrial fibrillation on telemetry. , Radiology, Transesophageal Echocardiogram - 6 ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , I was kindly asked to see this patient for transesophageal echocardiogram performance by Dr. A and Neurology.  Please see also my cardiovascular consultation dictated separately.  But essentially, this is a pleasant 72-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a large right MCA CVA causing a left-sided neurological deficit incidentally found to have atrial fibrillation on telemetry.  She has been recommended for a transesophageal echocardiogram for cardioembolic source of her CNS insult.,I discussed the procedure in detail with the patient as well as with her daughter, who was present at the patient's bedside with the patient's verbal consent.  I then performed a risk/benefit/alternative analysis with benefits being more definitive exclusion of intracardiac thrombus as well as assessment for intracardiac shunts; alternatives being transthoracic echo imaging, which she had already had, with an inherent false negativity for this indication as well as empiric medical management, which the patient was not interested in; risks including, but not limited to, and the patient was aware this was not an all-inclusive list, of oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, risk of oropharyngeal, esophageal, oral, tracheal, pulmonary and/or gastric perforation, hemorrhage, or tear.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk/benefit/alternative analysis, had the opportunity to ask questions, which I invited from her and her daughter, all of which were answered to their self-stated satisfaction.  The patient then stated in a clear competent and coherent fashion that she wished to go forward with the transesophageal echocardiogram.,PROCEDURE: , The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol under my direct supervision with appropriate identification of the patient, position, physician, procedure documentation; there were no safety issues identified by staff nor myself.  She received 20 cc of viscous lidocaine for topical oral anesthetic effect.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed and 100 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrated conscious sedation with continuous hemodynamic and oximetric monitoring with reasonable effect.  The multi-plane probe was passed using digital guidance for several passes, after an oral bite block had been put into place for protection of oral dentition.  This was placed into the posterior oropharynx and advanced into the esophagus, then advanced into the stomach and then rotated and withdrawn and removed with adequate imaging obtained throughout.  She was recovered as per the Medical Center conscious sedation protocol, and there were no apparent complications of the procedure.,FINDINGS: , Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.

The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.,After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.  This patient did not report any problems and reported pain reduction.","radiology, low back syndrome, low back pain, nerve root decompression, steroid solution, c-arm, epimed, tun l catheter, nerve root, negative aspiration, omnipaque dye, filling defect, nerve, root, catheter, adhesions, injection, needle,"

At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis.  Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  All major neurovascular structures were avoided.  At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.,Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  Compression was noted to be excellent.  All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.,A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A.

Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one finger's breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one finger's breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.  ,Interpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.  Four lesions were carried out.","radiology, sheath, vertebral body, regional pain syndrome, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, stellate ganglion, rftc, radiofrequency, radiograph, cricothyroid, thermocoagulation, ganglion,"

3211, The patient was admitted approximately 3 days ago with increasing shortness of breath secondary to pneumonia.  Pulmonary Medicine Associates have been contacted to consult in light of the ICU admission. , General Medicine, Shortness Of Breath - Progress Note ,"She was evaluated this a.m. and was without any significant clinical change.  Her white count has been improving and down to 12,000.  A chest x-ray obtained today showed some bilateral infiltrates, but no acute cardiopulmonary change.  There was a suggestion of a bilateral lower lobe pneumonitis or pneumonia.,She has been on Zosyn for the infection.,Throughout her hospitalization, we have been trying to adjust her pain medications.  She states that the methadone did not work for her.  She was ""immune"" to oxycodone.  She had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that.  There was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness.  She also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder.,Apparently, her husband was in this afternoon.  He had a box of her pain medications.  It is unclear whether she took a bunch of these or precisely what happened.  I was contacted that she was less responsive.  She periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications, which she has been requesting repeatedly, though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain.  The nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point.  There was a concern that she had taken some medications from home.  She was given Narcan and appeared to come around some.  Breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi, which certainly changed from this a.m.  Additional Narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse a possible benzodiazepine toxicity.  With O2 via mask, oxygenation was stable at 90% to 95% after initial hypoxia was noted.  A chest x-ray was obtained at this time.  An ECG was obtained, which shows a sinus tachycardia, noted to have ischemic abnormalities.,In light of the acute decompensation, she was then transferred to the ICU.  We will continue the IV Zosyn.  Respiratory protocol with respiratory management.  Continue alprazolam p.r.n., but avoid if she appears sedated.  We will attempt to avoid additional pain medications, but we will continue with the Dilaudid for time being.  I suspect she will need something to control her bipolar disorder.,Pulmonary Medicine Associates have been contacted to consult in light of the ICU admission.  At this juncture, she does not appear to need an intubation.  Pending chest x-ray, she may require additional IV furosemide.","general medicine, shortness of breath, pulmonary medicine, bipolar disorder, icuNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

3212, Chronic snoring in children, General Medicine, Snoring ,"CHRONIC SNORING,Chronic snoring in children can be associated with obstructive sleep apnea or upper airway resistant syndrome.  Both conditions may lead to sleep fragmentation and/or intermittent oxygen desaturation, both of which have significant health implications including poor sleep quality and stress on the cardiovascular system.  Symptoms like daytime somnolence, fatigue, hyperactivity, behavior difficulty (i.e., ADHD) and decreased school performance have been reported with these conditions.  In addition, the most severe cases may be associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary and/or systemic hypertension and even cor pulmonale.,In this patient, the risks for a sleep-disordered breathing include obesity and the tonsillar hypertrophy.  It is therefore indicated and medically necessary to perform a polysomnogram for further evaluation.

3213," He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the ""bad crowd"" and come up and live with his mom.", General Medicine, SOAP - Substance Abuse ,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the ""bad crowd"" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 164 pounds, blood pressure 108/60, pulse 88, respirations 16, and temperature was not taken.  General:  He is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Psychiatric:  Alert and oriented times 3.  Skin:  I examined his upper extremities.  He showed me his injection sites.  I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.,ASSESSMENT: , Substance abuse.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotics or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It has been one week without any sort of drugs at all.  I do not think he needs weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression needs to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effects in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medications carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he has any problems or side effects, he was also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three weeks for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He has to call on his own.  He has no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.  His mom is going to keep an eye on him as well.  He is going to be staying there.  It sounds like he is looking for a job.","general medicine, addicted to drugs, substance abuse, abuse, heroin, methadone"

Recommended a fiberoptic ENT exam to exclude adenoidal tissue that may be contributing to obstruction. , General Medicine, Sleep Apnea ,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Mr. ABC is a 30-year-old man who returns in followup of his still moderate-to-severe sleep apnea.  He returns today to review his response to CPAP.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment.,The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night.,The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night.,As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed.,In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures.,He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.

He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours.,The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.,MEDICATIONS: , He is maintained on Flonase and denies much in the way of nasal symptoms.,ALLERGIES: , Molds.,FINDINGS:  ,Vital signs:  Blood pressure 126/75, pulse 67, respiratory rate 16, weight 172 pounds, height 5 feet 9 inches, temperature 98.4 degrees and SaO2 is 99% on room air at rest.,The patient has adenoidal facies as noted previously.,Laboratories:  The patient forgot to bring his smart card in for downloading today.,ASSESSMENT: , Moderate-to-severe sleep apnea.  I have recommended the patient continue CPAP indefinitely.  He will be sending me his smart card for downloading to determine his CPAP usage pattern.  In addition, he will continue efforts to maintain his weight at current levels or below.  Should he succeed in reducing further, we might consider re-running a sleep study to determine whether he still requires a CPAP.,PLANS: , In the meantime, if it is also that the possible nasal obstruction is contributing to snoring and obstructive hypopnea.  I have recommended that a fiberoptic ENT exam be performed to exclude adenoidal tissue that may be contributing to obstruction.  He will be returning for routine followup in 6 months.","general medicine, daytime stamina, fiberoptic ent exam, moderate to severe, smart card, sleep apnea, cpap, apnea, sleep, "

She is currently on methadone maintenance.  She is being followed in Psychiatry for depression and substance abuse issues.  She lives with a room-mate.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Not contributory.,MEDICATIONS: , Current medications include the following:,1.  Methadone 110 mg by mouth every day.,2.  Paxil 60 mg by mouth every day.,3.  Trazodone 30 mg by mouth nightly.,4.  Seroquel 20 mg by mouth nightly.,5.  Avalide (irbesartan) and hydrochlorothiazide.,6.  Albuterol and Flovent inhalers two puffs by mouth twice a day.,7.

The remainders were stage II at 69 percent, stage III and IV at 3 percent of total sleep time.,The patient had no REM sleep.,The patient had no periodic limb movements during sleep.,The patient had no significant sleep-disordered breathing during non-REM sleep with less than one episode per hour.  Oxyhemoglobin saturation remained in the low to mid 90s throughout the night.,Intermittent inspiratory flow limitation compatible with snoring was observed during non-REM sleep.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This patient presents with history of sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness with fatigue.  Her symptoms are multifactorial.,Regarding the etiology of difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, the patient has a component of psychophysiologic insomnia, based on reports of better sleep in the laboratory as compared to home.  In addition, nontrivial smoking in the home setting may be contributing significantly to sleep disruption.,Regarding her daytime sleepiness, the patient is taking a number of long-acting central nervous system acting medications to sedate her and can produce a lasting sedation throughout the daytime.  These include trazodone, Seroquel, and methadone.  Of these medications, the methadone is clearly indicative, given the history of substance abuse.  It would be desirable to reduce or discontinue trazodone and then perhaps consider doing the same with Seroquel.  I brought this possibility up with the patient, and I asked her to discuss this further with her psychiatrist.,Finally, to help mitigate sleep disruption at night, I have provided her with tips for sleep hygiene.  These include bedtime rituals, stimulus control therapy, and sleep restriction as well as avoidance of nicotine in the evening hours.",
3218," Request for consultation to evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.", General Medicine, Request For Consultation ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Please evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a very pleasant 57-year old white female, a native of Cuba, being seen for evaluation and treatment of sores in her mouth that she has had for the last 10-12 days.  The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.  ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, Reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosions on the areas today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.  ,IMPRESSION: , Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.  ,I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  ,RECOMMENDED THERAPY: ,I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients’ skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.  ,Thank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  I will follow her with you as needed.","general medicine, stomatitis, nsaid, blistering, blisters, buccal mucosa, dermatitis, erosive stomatitis, gastrointestinal, methotrexate, mouth, rheumatoid arthritis, stomatitis conditions, superficial erosions, upper respiratory infection, illness, medication"

Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.  Her O2 saturations drifted downward.  They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%.  Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis.  She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks.  Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June.  Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.  Methotrexate is known on some occasions to cause pneumonitis.","general medicine, adrenal insufficiency, hypoxia, cough, fevers, weakness, chills, atypical pneumonia, loose stools, rheumatoid arthritis, azithromycin, arthritis, pneumonia, "

He described anorexia with occasional nausea and vomiting of non-bilious material along with a feeling of light-headedness that occurred shortly after standing from a sitting or lying position. He denied a productive cough but did note chronic left sided upper back pain located in the ribs that was worse with cough and better with massage. He denied orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but did become dyspneic after walking 2-3 blocks where before he had been able to jog 2-3 miles. He also noted that over the past year his left testicle had been getting progressively more swollen and painful.

A 61-year-old woman with a history of polyarteritis nodosa, mononeuritis multiplex involving the lower extremities, and severe sleep apnea returns in followup following an overnight sleep study.", General Medicine, Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 61-year-old woman with a history of polyarteritis nodosa, mononeuritis multiplex involving the lower extremities, and severe sleep apnea returns in followup following an overnight sleep study, on CPAP and oxygen to evaluate her for difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep.  She returns today to review results of an inpatient study performed approximately two weeks ago.,In the meantime, the patient reports she continues on substantial doses of opiate medication to control leg pain from mononeuritis multiplex.,She also takes Lasix for lower extremity edema.,The patient reports that she generally initiates sleep on CPAP, but rips her mask off, tosses and turns throughout the night and has ""terrible quality sleep."",MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are as previously noted.  Changes include reduction in prednisone from 9 to 6 mg by mouth every morning.  She continues to take Ativan 1 mg every six hours as needed.  She takes imipramine 425 mg at bedtime.,Her MS Contin dose is 150 mg every 8 to 12 hours and an immediate release morphine preparation, 45 to 75 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed.,FINDINGS: , Vital signs:  Blood pressure 153/81, pulse 90, respiratory rate 20, weight 311.8 pounds (up 10 pounds from earlier this month), height 5 feet 6 inches, temperature 98.4 degrees, SaO2 is 88% on room air at rest.  Chest is clear.  Extremities show lower extremity pretibial edema with erythema.,LABORATORIES: , An arterial blood gas on room air showed a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 52, and PO2 of 57.,CPAP compliance monitoring over the past two to three weeks showed average use of 3 hours 26 minutes on nights used.  She used it for greater than 4 hours per night on 67% of night surveyed.  Her estimated apnea/hypopnea index was 3 per hour.  Her average leak flow was 67 liters per minute.,The patient's overnight sleep study was performed as an inpatient sleep study during a routine hospitalization for intravenous gamma globulin therapy.  She slept for a total sleep time of 257 minutes out of 272 minutes in bed (sleep efficiency approximately 90%).  Sleep stage distribution was relatively normal with 2% stage I, 72% stage II, 24% stage III, IV, and 2% stage REM sleep.,There were no periodic limb movements during sleep.,There was evidence of a severe predominantly central sleep apnea during non-REM sleep at 173 episodes per hour and during REM sleep at 77 episodes per hour.  Oxyhemoglobin saturations during non-REM sleep fluctuated from the baseline of 92% to an average low of 82%.  During REM sleep, the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation was 87% , decreased to 81% with sleep-disordered breathing episodes.,Of note, the sleep study was performed on CPAP at 10.5 cm of H2O with oxygen at 8 liters per minute.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  The patient has evidence of a well-compensated respiratory acidosis, which is probably primarily related to severe obesity.  In addition, there may be contribution from large doses of opiates and standing doses of gabapentin.,2.  Severe central sleep apnea, on CPAP at 10 cmH2O and supplemental oxygen at 8 liters per minute.  The breathing pattern is that of cluster or Biot's breathing throughout sleep.  The primary etiology is probably opiate use, with contribution with further exacerbation by severe obesity which acts to lower the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation, and worsen desaturations during apneic episodes.,3.  Mononeuritis multiplex with pain requiring significant substantial doses of analgesia.,4.  Hypoxemia primarily due to obesity, hypoventilation, and presumably basilar atelectasis and a combination of V/Q mismatch and shunt on that basis.,PLANS: , My overall impression is that we should treat this patient's sleep disruption with measures to decrease central sleep apnea during sleep.  These will include, (1).  Decrease in evening doses of MS Contin, (2).  Modest weight loss of approximately 10 to 20 pounds, and (3).  Instituting Automated Servo Ventilation via nasal mask.  With regard to latter, the patient will be returning for a trial of ASV to examine its effect on sleep-disordered breathing patterns.,In addition, the patient will benefit from modest diuresis, with improvement of oxygenation, as well as nocturnal desaturation and oxygen requirements.  I have encouraged the patient to increase her dose of Lasix from 100 to 120 mg by mouth every morning as previously prescribed.  I have also asked her to add Lasix in additional late afternoon to evening dose of Lasix at 40 mg by mouth at that time.  She was instructed to take between one and two K-Tab with her evening dose of Lasix (10 to 20 mEq).,In addition, we will obtain a complete set of pulmonary function studies to evaluate this patient for underlying causes of parenchymal lung disease that may interfere with oxygenation.  Further workup for hypoxemia may include high-resolution CT scanning if evidence for significant pulmonary restriction and/or reductions in diffusion capacity is evident on pulmonary function testing.","general medicine, polyarteritis nodosa, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary function, obesity hypoventilation, mononeuritis multiplex, sleep apnea, sleep study, rem sleep, ativan, sleep, hypoventilation, obesity, "

At the time of my exam, he states that his left lower extremity pain has improved considerably.  He apparently had more significant paresthesias in the past and now he feels that the paresthesias have improved considerably.  He does have a history of multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, he is on Coumadin, which is currently subtherapeutic, multiple CVAs in the past, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure.  He has multiple chronic history of previous ischemia of his large bowel in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAM,VITAL SIGNS:  Currently his temperature is 98.2, pulse is 95, and blood pressure is 138/98.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  An irregular rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.,EXTREMITIES:  His upper extremities are well perfused.  He has palpable radial and femoral pulses.  He does not have any palpable pedal pulses in either right or left lower extremity.  He does have reasonable capillary refill in both feet.  He has about one second capillary refill on both the right hand and left lower extremities and his left foot is perhaps little cool, but it is relatively warm.  Apparently, this was lot worst few hours ago.  He describes significant pain and pallor, which he feels has improved and certainly clinically at this point does not appear to be as significant.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , This gentleman with a history of multiple comorbidities as detailed above had what sounds clinically like acute exacerbation of chronic peripheral vascular disease, essentially related to spasm versus a small clot, which may have been lysed to some extent.  He currently has a viable extremity and viable foot, but certainly has significant making compromised flow.  It is unclear to me whether this is chronic or acute, and whether he is a candidate for any type of intervention.  He certainly would benefit from an angiogram to better to define his anatomy and anticoagulation in the meantime.  Given his potential history of recent lower GI bleeding, he has been evaluated by GI to see whether or not he is a candidate for heparinization.  We will order an angiogram for the next few hours and followup on those results to better define his anatomy and to determine whether or not if any interventions are appropriate.  Again, at this point, he has no pain, relatively rapid capillary refill, and relatively normal motor function suggesting a viable extremity.  We will follow him along closely.","general medicine, blood in stool, nausea, capillary refill, angiogram, hernia, extremity, "

Seizure disorder.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Colonoscopy.,2.  Right hemicolectomy.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia.  She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS: , The patient was discharged to home.  She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.  Her discharge diet was to be her usual diet of isotonic fiber feeding through the J-tube at a rate of 120 per hour throughout the night.  The discharge medications were as follows:,1.  Coreg 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. at bedtime.,3.  Nitro-Dur patch 0.3 mg per hour one patch daily.,4.  Phenergan syrup 6.25 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.,5.  Synthroid 0.175 mg p.o. daily.,6.

If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This does appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.,3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He has refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.,4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.  Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes.","general medicine, anemia, gi bleeding, hemoglobin, ulcerative, esophagitis, obstructive pulmonary disease, icu followup, infection, obstructive, pulmonary, egd, melena, bleeding"

", General Medicine, Lesions - Adrenal and Pancreatic ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Both pancreatic and left adrenal lesions.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This 60-year-old white male is referred to us by his medical physician with a complaint of recent finding of a both pancreatic lesion and lesions with left adrenal gland.  The patient's history dates back to at the end of the January of this past year when he began experiencing symptoms consistent with difficulty almost like a suffocating feeling whenever he would lie flat on his back.  He noticed whenever he would recline backwards, he would begin this feeling and it is so bad now that he can barely recline, very little before he has this feeling.  He is now sleeping in an upright position.  He was sent for CAT scan originally of his chest.  The CAT scan of the chest reveals a pneumonitis, but also saw a left adrenal nodule and a small pancreatic lesion.  He was subsequently was sent for a dedicated abdominal CAT scan and MRI.  The CAT scan revealed 1.8-cm lesion of his left adrenal gland, suspected to be a benign adenoma.  The pancreas showed pancreatic lesion towards the mid body tail aspect of the pancreas, approximately 1 cm, most likely of cystic nature.  Neoplasm could not be excluded.  He was referred to us for further assessment.  He denies any significant abdominal pain, any nausea or vomiting.  His appetite is fine.  He has had no significant changes in his bowel habits or any rectal bleeding or melena.  He has undergone a colonoscopy in September of last year and was found to have three adenomatous polyps.  He does have a history of frequent urination.  Has been followed by urologist for this.  There is no family history of pancreatic cancer.  There is a history of gallstone pancreatitis in the patient's sister.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, and high cholesterol.,ALLERGIES: , ENVIRONMENTAL.,MEDICATIONS:,  Include glipizide 5 mg b.i.d., metformin 500 mg b.i.d., Atacand 16 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg daily, pantoprazole 40 mg daily, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, Detrol 4 mg daily, Zyrtec 10 mg daily, Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg one puff b.i.d., and fluticasone spray 50 mcg two sprays daily.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  He has not had any previous surgery.,FAMILY HISTORY: , His brothers had prostate cancer.

3273," Patient with Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, large cardioembolic stroke initially to the right brain requesting medical management", General Medicine, Medical Management Consult Request ,"CONSULT REQUEST FOR:, Medical management.,The patient has been in special procedures now for over 2 hours and I am unable to examine.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, Obtained from Dr. A on an 81-year-old white female, who is right handed, who by history, had a large stroke to the right brain, causing left body findings, last night. She was unfortunately outside of the window for emergent treatment and had a negative CT scan of the head. Was started on protocol medication and that is similar to TPA, which is an investigational study.,During the evaluation she was found to be in atrial fibrillation on admission with hypertension that was treated with labetalol en route. Her heart rate was 130. She was brought down with Cardizem. She received the study drug in the night and about an hour later thought to have another large stroke effecting the opposite side of the brain, that the doctors and company think is probably cardioembolic and not related to the study drug, as TPA has no obvious known association with this.,At that time the patient became comatose and required emergent intubation and paralyzation. Her diastolic at that time rose up to 190, likely the result of the acute second stroke. She is currently in arteriogram and a clot has been extracted from the proximal left carotid, but there is still distal clot that they are working on. Dr. A has updated the family to her extremely guarded and critical prognosis.,At present, it is not known yet, we do not have the STAT echocardiogram, if she has a large clot in the heart or if she could have a patent foramen ovale clot in the legs that has been passed to the heart. Echo that is pending, and cannot be done till the patient is out of arteriogram, which is her lifesaving procedure right now.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Complete review of systems is unobtainable at present. From what I can tell, is that she is scheduled for an upcoming bladder distension surgery and I do not know if this is why she is off Coumadin for chronic AFib or what, at this point. Tremor for 3-4 years, diagnosed as early Parkinson's.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, GERD, hypertension times 20 years, arthritis, Parkinson's, TIA, chronic atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin three years.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, Cholecystectomy, TAH 33, gallstones, back surgery 1998, thoracotomy for unknown reason at present.,ALLERGIES:, MORPHINE, SULFAS (RASH), PROZAC.,MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Lanoxin 0.25 daily; Inderal LA 80 daily; MOBIC 7.5 daily; Robaxin 750 q.8; aspirin 80 one daily; acyclovir dose unknown daily; potassium, dose unknown; oxazepam 15 mg daily; aspirin 80 one daily; ibuprofen PRN; Darvocet-N 100 PRN.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, She does not drink or smoke. Lives in Fayetteville, Tennessee.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Mother died of cancer, unknown type. Dad died of an MI.,VACCINATION STATUS: Unknown.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: On arrival were temperature 97.1, blood pressure 174/100, heart rate 100, 97%, respirations 15.,GENERAL: She was apparently alert and able to give history on arrival. Currently do not have any available vital signs or physical exam, as I cannot get to the patient.,LABORATORY: ,Reviewed and are remarkable for white count of 13 with 76 neutrophils. BMP is normal, except for a blood sugar of 157, hemoglobin A1c is pending. TSH 2.1, cholesterol 165, Digoxin 1.24, CPK 57. ABG 7.47/32/459 on 100%. Magnesium 1.5. ESR 9, coags normal.,EKG is pending my review.,Chest x-ray is read as mild cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic aorta.,Chest x-ray, shoulder films and CT scan of the head: I have reviewed. Chest x-ray has good ET tube placement. She has mild cardiomegaly. Some mild interstitial opacities consistent with OGD and minimal amount of atherosclerosis of the aorta.,CT scan of the head: I do not see any active bleeding.,X-rays of the shoulders appear intact to me and we are awaiting radiologies final approval on those.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN/PROBLEMS:,1. Large cardioembolic stroke initially to the right brain, with devastating effects, and now stroke into the left brain as well, with fluctuating mental status. Obviously she is in critical condition and stable with multiple strokes. One must also wonder if she could have a large clot burden below the heart and patent foramen ovale, etc. We need STAT records from her prior cardiologist and prior echocardiogram report to see exactly what are the details. I have ordered a STAT echo and to have the group that sees her read it, that if he has a large clot burdened in the heart or has distal clot with a PFO we may be able to better prognosticate at this point. Obviously, she cannot have any anticoagulants, except for the study drug, at present, which is her only chance and hopefully they will be able to retrieve most of the clot with emergency retrieval device as activated heroically, by Dr. A and interventional radiology.,2. Hypertension/atrial fibrillation: This will be a difficult management and the fact that she has been on a beta-blocker for Parkinson's, she may have withdrawal to the beta-blockers as we remove this. Given her atrial fibrillation, I do agree the safest agent right now is to use a Cardizem drip as needed and would use it for systolic greater than 160 to 180, or diastolics greater than 90 to 100. Also, would use it to control the atrial fibrillation. We would, however, be very cautious not to put her in heart block with the Digoxin and the beta-blocker on board. Weighing all risks and benefits, I think that given the fact that she has a beta-blocker on board and Digoxin, we would like to avoid the beta-blocker for vasospasm protection and will favor using calcium channel blocker for now. If, however, we run into trouble with this, I would prefer to switch her to Brevibloc or an Esmolol drip and see how she does, as she may withdraw from the beta-blocker. I will be watching this closely and managing the hypertension as I see fit at the moment, based on all factors. Will also ask cardiology if she has one that sees her here, to help guide this. Her Digoxin level is appropriate, as well as a TSH. I do not feel that we need to work this up further, other than the STAT echo and ultrasound of the leg.,3. Respiratory failure requiring ventilator: I have discussed this with Dr. Devlin, we do not feel the need to hyperventilate her at present. We will keep her comfortable on the breathing machine and try to keep her pH in a normal range, around 7.4, and her CO2 in the 30 to 40 range. If she has brain swelling, we will need to hyperventilate her to a pCO2 of 30 and a pH of 7.5, to optimize the cardiac arrhythmia potential of alkalosis weighed with the control of brain swelling.,4. Optimize electrolytes as you can.,5. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis for now, with thigh-high TED hose, possibly SCDs, although I do not have experience with the vampire/venom to know if we need to worry about DIC which the SCDs may worsen. Will follow daily CBCs for that.,6. Nutrition: Will go ahead and start a low dose of tube feeds and hope that she does survive.,I will defer all updates to the family for the next 24 to 48 hours to Dr. Devlin's expertise, given her unknown and fluctuating neurologic prognosis.,Thank you so much for allowing us to participate in her care. We will be happy to do all medication treatment until the point that I feel that I would need any help from critical care. I believe that we will be able to manage her fully at this point, for simplicity sake.",

The patient underwent an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which has since healed.  On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound.  She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom.  She is having good ostomy output.  She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy.  She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work.  She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain.  She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds.  This is a pleasant female in no acute distress.  The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar.  There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant.  There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR.  She is functioning well with her ileostomy.  She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.  I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less.  I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks.  I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy.  She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain.  I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain.  I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain.  The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery.  This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping.  I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery.  I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her.  Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well.  Again, her quality of life is significantly improved.  She is happy with her performance.  We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time.","gastroenterology, perineal wound, wound infection, wound, wound check, ulcerative colitis, apr, ileostomyNOTE"

3463, Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction., Gastroenterology, Upper Endoscopy  ,"PROCEDURE:,  Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , A 92-year-old lady with history of dysphagia on and off for two years.  She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva.  This started almost a day earlier.  She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything.  She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , Informed consent was obtained from patient.  The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed.  Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks.  Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus.  There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus.  This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots.  The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation.  Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.,The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation.  Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net.  Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft.  Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out.  Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully.  The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy.  No active bleeding was seen.  There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach.  As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.,IMPRESSION: , Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.  Treated as described above.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  IV Protonix 40 mg q.12h.  Clear liquid diet for 24 hours.  If the patient is stable, thereafter she may take soft pureed diet only until next endoscopy, which will be scheduled in three to four weeks.  She should take Prevacid SoluTab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge.","gastroenterology, dysphagia, removal of food impaction, distal esophagus, stomach, distal esophageal, esophageal stricture, upper endoscopy, food impaction, endoscopy, aspiration, sedation, bolus, impaction, esophagus, "

He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room.  He was placed in a supine position on the operating table.  After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll.  Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion.  After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace.  The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered.  The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure.  The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.,Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid.  Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis.  The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated.  A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed.  There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity.  The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored.  The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus.  It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area.  The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair.  After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French.  These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.,The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures.  The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.,The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position.  A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed.  A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced.  The laparoscope was introduced.  A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced.  It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance.  The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely.  The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique.  Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire.  #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated.  We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall.  The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position.  As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube.  Sterile dressing was applied.

He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.,OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: ,A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.",

He is for exam under anesthesia and control of hemorrhage at this time.,FINDINGS: , There was an ulcer where most of the polypoid lesion had been excised before.  In a near total fashion the wound had opened and again there was a raw ulcer surface in between the edges of the mucosa.  There were a few discrete sites of mild oozing, which were treated with cautery and #1 suture.  No other obvious bleeding was seen.,TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operative table in supine position.  After adequate general anesthesia was induced, the patient was then placed in modified prone position.  His buttocks were taped, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The anterior rectal wall was exposed using a Parks anal retractor.  The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery.  There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well.  This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture.  At the completion, there was no bleeding, no oozing, it was completely dry, and we removed our retractor, and the patient was then turned and extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","gastroenterology, diarrhea, anterior base lesion, polypoid lesion, transanal excision, transanal, anesthesia, bleeding,"

After discussion with the patient and the son, they agreed to place a PEG tube for nutritional supplementation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  He was placed in the supine position and was given IV sedation by the Anesthesia Department.  An EGD was performed from above by Dr. X.  The stomach was transilluminated and an optimal position for the PEG tube was identified using the single poke method.  The skin was infiltrated with local and the needle and sheath were inserted through the abdomen into the stomach under direct visualization.  The needle was removed and a guidewire was inserted through the sheath.  The guidewire was grasped from above with a snare by the endoscopist.  It was removed completely and the Ponsky PEG tube was secured to the guidewire.,The guidewire and PEG tube were then pulled through the mouth and esophagus and snug to the abdominal wall.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  Photos were taken.  The Bolster was placed on the PEG site.  A complete dictation for the EGD will be done separately by Dr. X.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.

At the present time, the patient is under radiation treatment.  Two weeks ago or so, she developed a large abdominal mass, which was cystic in nature and the radiologist inserted a pigtail catheter in the emergency room.  We proceeded to admit the patient and drained a significant amount of clear fluid in the subsequent days.  The cytology of the fluid was negative and the culture was also negative.  Eventually, the patient was sent home with the pigtail shut off and the patient a week later underwent a repeat CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.,The CAT scan showed accumulation of the fluid and the mass almost achieving 80% of the previous size.  Therefore, I called the patient home and she came to the emergency department where the service was provided.  At that time, I proceeded to work on the pigtail catheter after obtaining an informed consent and preparing and draping the area in the usual fashion.  Unfortunately, the catheter was open.  I did not have a drainage system at that time.  So, I withdrew directly with a syringe 700 mL of clear fluid.  The system was connected to the draining bag, and the patient was instructed to keep a log and how to use equipment.  She was given an appointment to see me in the office next Monday, which is three days from now.","gastroenterology, abdominal mass, clear fluid, cat scan, pigtail catheter, paracentesis,"

The patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07/25/2003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the Orthopedics Department.  Subsequently, the patient was doing well postoperatively, however, the patient does have severe O2 and steroid-dependent COPD and at an extreme risk for any procedure.  The patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08/07/2003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain.  During the evaluation, the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 08/08/03, the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder.  The patient did well postdrainage.  The patient's laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp.  However, once the tube was removed, the patient re-obstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed; this was done on 08/16/2003.  A HIDA scan had been performed, which showed no cystic duct obstruction.  A tube cholecystogram was performed, which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction.  There was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder, however, the pathway was patent.  Thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies, extensive discussions were made with the family and the patient's only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy.  Initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, with the patient's severe COPD and risk for ventilator management, the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas.  There were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder.  The patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia.  Local anesthesia was given with 1% lidocaine.  A paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a #15 blade scalpel.  Next, hemostasis was obtained using electro Bovie cautery.  Dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia, which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a #10 blade scalpel.  Next, Metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered .  The gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view, grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view.  Dissection with a ______ was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct, which were both easily identified.  The cystic artery was clipped, two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with Metzenbaum scissors.  The cystic duct was identified.  A silk tie #3-0 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with #3-0 silk and then cutting in between with a Metzenbaum scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro Bovie cautery.  A plane was created.  The hemostasis was obtained using the electro Bovie cautery as well as some Surgicel.  The gallbladder was then removed as specimen, sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis, of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections.  Permanent sections are still pending.  The remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the Surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen.  The peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running #0 Vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin staples were used on the skin and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition.","gastroenterology, open cholecystectomy, hemorrhagic, gallbladder, serosal, liver bed, acute acalculous, acalculous cholecystitis, cystic duct, bovie cautery, rectus fascia, metzenbaum scissors, fascia, cholecystitis, cholecystectomy, cystic,"
3482, Nissen fundoplication.   A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process. , Gastroenterology, Nissen Fundoplication ,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Nissen fundoplication.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities.  TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.  Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.,A 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction.  A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg.  A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed.  Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.  The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position.,The triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula.  The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane.  The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane.  The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice.  This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus.  Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.,The liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.  The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve.  This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve.,Attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus.  At its left border, the left crus was identified.  The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed.  The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch.  By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.,The next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch.  This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel.  This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade.  The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port.  Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall.  Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus.  A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus.  The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.,The 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired.  Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.,The last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve.  With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left.  It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap.  The,52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.","gastroenterology, umbilicus, insufflation, phrenoesophageal membrane, nissen fundoplication, gastric pouch, esophagus, penrose, antireflux, nissen, fundoplication, trocars, ligament,"

The patient states that he was well until about three days prior to presentation when he first started to experience some pain when defecating.  The following day he noted increasing pain and first noted blood on the surface of his stool.  The pain worsened on the subsequent day with increasing bleeding as well as some mucopurulent anal discharge.  The patient denies any previous history of rectal bleeding or pain.  He also denies any previous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and states that he was screened for HIV infection eight months ago and was negative.  The patient does state that he has not felt well for the past week.  He states that he had felt ""feverish"" on several occasions but has not taken his temperature.  He has also complained of some abdominal discomfort with nausea and diarrhea as well as generalized myalgias and fatigue.  He thinks he has lost a few pounds but has not been weighing himself to determine the exact amount of weight loss.,The patient states that he has been sexually active since age 13.  He admits to eight previous partners and states that he ""usually"" uses a condom.  On further questioning, the patient states that of his eight partners, three were female and five were male.  His most recent sexual partner was a 38-year-old man whom he has been with for the past six months.  He states that he has been tested for STDs in the past but states that he only gave urine and blood for the testing.  He is unaware of the HIV status of his partner but assumes that the partner is uninfected because he looks healthy.  The patient also admits to one episode of sexual abuse at the age of 8 by a friend of the family.  As the man was a member of the family's church, the patient never felt comfortable disclosing this to any of the adults in his life.  He is very concerned about disclosure of his sexual behavior to his family, as they have expressed very negative comments concerning men who have sex with men.

The patient also presents with some constitutional symptoms including fever, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and adenopathy on physical examination.  The following are in the differential diagnosis:  Acute Proctitis and  Proctocolitis.,ACUTE HIV SEROCONVERSION: , This subject is sexually active and reports inconsistent condom use.  Gastrointestinal symptoms have recently been reported commonly in patients with a history of HIV seroconversion.  The rectal symptoms of bleeding and pain are not common with HIV, and an alternative diagnosis would be required.,PERIRECTAL ABSCESS: , A patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent STD.  The patient could experience more systemic symptoms with fever and malaise, as found with this patient.  However, the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edema.,DIAGNOSIS:  ,The subject had rectal cultures obtained, which were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  An HIV ELISA was positive, as was the RNA PCR.,DISCUSSION: , This patient demonstrates a number of key issues to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult.  First, the patient utilized the emergency department for care as opposed to identifying a primary care provider.  Although not ideal in many circumstances, testing for HIV infection is crucial when there is suspicion, since many newly diagnosed patients identify earlier contacts with health care providers when HIV counseling and testing were not performed.  Second, this young man has had both male and female sexual partners.  As young people explore their sexuality, asking about partners in an open, nonjudgmental manner without applying labels is integral to helping the young person discuss their sexual behaviors.  Assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have same-sex attractions.  Third, screening for STDs must take into account sexual behaviors.  Although urine-based screening has expanded testing of young people, it misses anal and pharyngeal infections.  If a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse, urine screening is insufficient to rule out STDs.  Fourth, this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms.  As his anal symptoms were most suggestive of a current STD, performing an HIV test should be part of the standard evaluation.  In addition, as acute infection is on the differential diagnosis, PCR testing should also be considered.  The care provided to this young man included the following.  He was treated presumptively for proctitis with both IM ceftriaxone as well as oral doxycycline to treat N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis.  Ceftriaxone was chosen due to the recent reports of resistant N gonorrhoeae.  At the time of the diagnosis, the young man was given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescent-specific HIV program.  The case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support.  The case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four days later.  Over the subsequent three months, the young man had two sets of laboratory testing to stage his HIV infection.,Set #1 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 225 cells/mm3, 15% ,Quantitative RNA PCR = 75,000 copies/mL",

He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital.  A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases.  The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.  The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent.  This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct.  A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage.  The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable.  He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests.  Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission.  This responded to Zofran.  It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself.  At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585,000.

The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.,1.  Epigastric pain.  The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time.  In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.  His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.  He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.,2.  End-stage liver disease.  Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis.  We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.  We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.  Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result.  It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.,We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.  We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver.  We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also.  We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.  PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.  Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.  On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.  We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.  I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.  We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.  The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.  We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.,At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily.  The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.  I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.  As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.  The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.  He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.  The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.  The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.,Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.,We also discussed nutrition issues.  The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.  He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.  He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.  His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.","gastroenterology, abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, liver disease, epigastric pain, liver cirrhosis, liver, abdominal, cirrhosis, epigastric, hepatitis,"

Right hemicolectomy.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia.  She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS: , The patient was discharged to home.  She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.  Her discharge diet was to be her usual diet of isotonic fiber feeding through the J-tube at a rate of 120 per hour throughout the night.  The discharge medications were as follows:,1.

She admits to some nausea associated with it.  There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms.  The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant.  She had a leukocytosis of 12.8.  She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis.  Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy.  The risks, benefits, complications of the procedure, she gave us informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Exploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it was slightly enlarged.  The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts.  There was no evidence of adnexal masses and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes.  The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV.  After adequate sedation was achieved, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle.  Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was insufflated approximately 15 mmHg.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  A video laparoscope was inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen was explored.  Next, a 5 mm port was inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region.  This was inserted under direct visualization.  Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal was created.  This was performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision.  A bladed trocar was inserted into the suprapubic region.  This was done again under direct visualization.  Maryland dissector was inserted into the suprapubic region and a window was created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum.  This was done while the 5 mm trocar was used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly.  Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix was transected and doubly stapled with this device.  Next, the mesoappendix was doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device.  The staple line was visualized and there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdomen was fully irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The abdomen was then aspirated.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  All ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding from the port sites.  The infraumbilical and suprapubic ports were then closed.  The fascias were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle.  Once the fascias were closed, all incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The areas were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound.  Sterile dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was extubated following the procedure, returned to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  She will be admitted to General Medical Floor and she will be followed closely in the early postoperative course.","gastroenterology, lower quadrant, diagnostic laparoscopy, acute appendicitis, laparoscopic appendectomy, abdomen, appendectomy, laparoscopy, appendix, suprapubic,"

Please see dictated ICU transfer note yesterday detailing the need for emergent transfer transfusion and EGD in this patient.  Over the last 24 hours, the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value.  He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X.  I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding.  Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future.  The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU.  He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8.

EGD, final results pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without signs of active bleeding at this time.,IMPRESSION/PLAN,1.  Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis.  We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding.  If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This does appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.,3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He has refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.,4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.  Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes.","gastroenterology, anemia, gi bleeding, hemoglobin, ulcerative, esophagitis, obstructive pulmonary disease, icu followup, infection, obstructive, pulmonary, egd, melena, bleeding"

She does complain of some frequent urination.  Her vaginal bleeding is minimal.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the uterus is approximately 6-week size, anteverted, and freely mobile with no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, there is a small hemostatic perforation noted on the left posterior aspect of the uterus.  There is approximately 40 cc of serosanguineous fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.  There is no evidence of endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac or along the bladder flap.  There is no evidence of injury to the bowel or pelvic sidewall.  The liver margin, gallbladder and remainder of the bowel including the appendix appeared normal.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the Operating Room where general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterine manipulator was then placed into the patient's cervix and the vulsellum tenaculum and sterile speculum were removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  Veress needle was placed through this incision and the gas turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision.  The camera was placed with the above findings noted.  A 5 mm step trocar was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline.  A blunt probe was placed through this trocar to help for visualization of the pelvic and abdominal organs.  The serosanguineous fluid of the cul-de-sac was aspirated and the pelvis was copiously irrigated with sterile saline.  At this point, Dr. X was consulted.  He performed a rigid sigmoidoscopy, please see his dictation for further details.  There does not appear to be any evidence of colonic injury.  The saline in the pelvis was then suctioned out using Nezhat-Dorsey.  All instruments were removed.  The 5 mm trocar was removed under direct visualization with excellent hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar removed.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision sites for postoperative pain relief.

The patient was found to have cholelithiasis on last admission.  He was being worked up for this including cardiac clearance.  However, in the interim, he returned again with another episode of same pain.  The patient had a HIDA scan done yesterday, which shows nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction.  Because of these, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was advised with cholangiogram.  Possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure was also explained to the patient.  The procedure, indications, risks, and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia.  The entire abdomen was prepped and draped.  A small transverse incision was made about 2-1/2 inches above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia.  The patient has a rather long torso.  Fascia was opened vertically and stay sutures were placed in the fascia.  Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.  Hasson cannula was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it was insufflated with CO2.  Laparoscopic camera was inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg and rotated to the left.  An 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region.  Slowly, the dissection was carried out in the right subhepatic area.  Initially, I was able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver.  Then, some inflammatory changes were noted with some fatty necrosis type of changes and it was not quite clear whether this was part of the gallbladder or it was just pericholecystic infection/inflammation.  The visualization was extremely difficult because of the patient's obesity and a lot of fat intra-abdominally, although his abdominal wall is not that thick.  After evaluating this for a little while, we decided that there was no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy.  The trocars were removed.,A right subcostal incision was made and peritoneal cavity was entered.  A Bookwalter retractor was put in place.  The dissection was then carried out on the undersurface of the liver.  Eventually, the gallbladder was identified, which was markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it.  Dissection was further carried down to what was felt to be the common bile duct, which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size.  The duodenum was kocherized.  The gallbladder was partly intrahepatic.  Because of this, I decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem.  The inferior wall of the gallbladder was opened and two large stones, one was about 3 cm long and another one about 1.5 x 2 cm long, were taken out of the gallbladder.,It was difficult to tell where the cystic duct was.  Eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder, I did find the cystic duct, which was relatively very short.  Intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done using C-arm fluoroscopy.  This showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone.  At this time, a decision was made to proceed with common duct exploration.  The common duct was opened between stay sutures of 4-0 Vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out.  After some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver, the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct.  So, it was about a 1-cm size stone, which was removed.  Following this, a 10-French red rubber catheter was passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously.  No further stones were obtained.  The catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater.  At this point, a choledochoscope was inserted and proximally, I did not see any evidence of any common duct stones or proximally into the biliary tree.  However, a stone was found distally still floating around.  This was removed with stone forceps.  The bile ducts were irrigated again.  No further stones were removed.  A 16-French T-tube was then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct was repaired around the T-tube using 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures obtaining watertight closure.  A completion T-tube cholangiogram was done at this time, which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct, although externally, I was unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area.  Because of this, the T-tube was removed, and I passed the choledochoscope proximally again, and I was unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area.  I felt at this time this was most likely an impression from the outside, which was still left over a gallbladder where the stone was stuck and it was impressing on the bile duct.  The bile duct lumen was widely open.  T-tube was again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion T-tube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time.  The cystic duct opening through which I had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram, this was closed with a figure-of-eight suture of 2-0 Vicryl, and this was actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this area.,The remaining gallbladder bed, which was left in situ, was cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining.  Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution.  Hemostasis was good.  A 10-mm Jackson-Pratt drain was left in the foramen of Winslow and brought out through the lateral 5-mm port site.  The T-tube was brought out through the middle 5-mm port site, which was just above the incision.  Abdominal incision was then closed in layers using 0 Vicryl running suture for the peritoneal layer and #1 Novafil running suture for the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl running sutures in two layers.  Subfascial and subcutaneous tissues were injected with a total of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine for postoperative pain control.  The umbilical incision was closed with 0 Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures for the fascia, 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues, and staples for the skin.  Sterile dressing was applied, and the patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition.","gastroenterology, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, biliary colic, choledocholithiasis, laparoscopy, laparotomy, cholecystectomy, cholangiogram, choledocholithotomy, choledochoscopy, t-tube drainage, cystic duct cholangiogram, common bile duct, peritoneal cavity, gallbladder"

A curvilinear incision was made below the umbilicus.  Through this incision, the camera port was able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization.  Once this complete, insufflation was begun.  Once insufflation was adequate, additional ports were placed in the epigastrium as well as right upper quadrant.  Once all four ports were placed, the right upper quadrant was then explored.  The patient had significant adhesions of omentum and colon to the liver, the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis.  This was taken down using Bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall.  Adhesions were further taken down between the omentum, the colon, and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area.  Once the adhesions were fully removed, the cholangiogram was done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction.  At this point, due to the patient's gallbladder being very necrotic, it was deemed that the patient should have a drain placed.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected.  The gallbladder was removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder.  Adequate hemostasis with Bovie cautery was achieved.  The gallbladder was then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port.  A JP drain was then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar sites and secured to the skin using 3-0 nylon suture.  Next, the right upper quadrant was copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator.  Once this was complete, the additional ports were able to be removed.  The fascial opening at the umbilicus was reinforced by closing it using a 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-8 fashion.  All skin incisions were injected using Marcaine 1/4 percent plain.  The skin was reapproximated further using 4-0 Monocryl sutures in a subcuticular technique.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.","gastroenterology, acute cholecystitis, cholangiogram, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, gallbladder, gangrenous cholecystitis, bovie cautery, cystic duct, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic, cholecystectomy, cystic, duct,"

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 3 other trocars were placed.  The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position.  The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 3 cm above the anterior superior iliac spine.  The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.,The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder.  A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.,A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct close to the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the upper midline cannula and a fine-tipped scissors introduced through the third cannula and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct near the clips.  Several attempts at passing the cholangiocatheter into the ductotomy were made.  Despite numerous attempts at several angles, the cholangiocatheter could not be inserted into the cystic duct.  After several such attempts, and due to the fact that the anatomy was clear, we aborted any further attempts at cholangiography.  The distal cystic duct was doubly clipped.  The duct was divided between the clips.  The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct.  The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.,The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posteriorly to the cystic duct.  It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues.  A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally.  The artery was divided between the clips.  The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.,After the cystic duct and artery were transected, the gallbladder was dissected from the liver bed using Bovie electrocautery.  Prior to complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver, the peritoneal cavity was copiously irrigated with saline and the operative field was examined for persistent blood or bile leaks of which there were none.,After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula.  The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula.  As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen.  The neck of the gallbladder was then secured with a Kocher clamp, and the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen.,Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.,Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture.

All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.","gastroenterology, gastric bypass, eea anastomosis, roux-en-y, antegastric, antecolic, morbid obesity, roux limb, gastric pouch, intubation, laparoscopic, bypass, roux, endotracheal, anastomosis, gastric"

The patient complained of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating after eating fatty foods.  She had had multiple attacks in the past of these complaints.  She was discovered to have had right upper quadrant pain on examination.  Additionally, she had an ultrasound performed on 08/04/2003, which revealed cholelithiasis.  The patient was recommended to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for her recurrent symptoms.  She was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and she gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  The patient received preoperative antibiotics with Kefzol.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient did undergo general endotracheal anesthesia.  Once the adequate sedation was achieved, a supraumbilical transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel.  Utilizing a Veress needle, the Veress needle was inserted intra-abdominally and was hooked to the CO2 insufflation.  The abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg.  After adequate insufflation was achieved, the laparoscopic camera was inserted into the abdomen and to visualize a distended gallbladder as well as omental adhesion adjacent to the gallbladder.  Decision to proceed with laparoscopic cystectomy was decided.  A subxiphoid transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel and utilizing a bladed 12 mm trocar, the trocar was inserted under direct visualization into the abdomen.  Two 5 mm ports were placed, one at the midclavicular line 2 cm below the costal margin and a second at the axillary line, one hand length approximately below the costal margin.  All ports were inserted with bladed 5 mm trocar then under direct visualization.  After all trocars were inserted, the gallbladder was grasped at the fundus and retracted superiorly and towards the left shoulder.  Adhesions adjacent were taken down with a Maryland dissector.  Once this was performed, the infundibulum of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted laterally and anteriorly.  This helped to better delineate the cystic duct as well as the cystic artery.  Utilizing Maryland dissector, careful dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery were created posteriorly behind each one.  Utilizing Endoclips, clips were placed on the cystic duct and cystic artery, one proximal to the gallbladder and two distally.  Utilizing endoscissors, the cystic duct and cystic artery were ligated.  Next, utilizing electrocautery, the gallbladder was carefully dissected off the liver bed.  Electrocautery was used to stop any bleeding encountered along the way.  The gallbladder was punctured during dissection and cleared, biliary contents did drained into the abdomen.  No evidence of stones were visualized.  Once the gallbladder was completely excised from the liver bed, an EndoCatch was placed and the gallbladder was inserted into EndoCatch and removed from the subxiphoid port.  This was sent off as an specimen, a gallstone was identified within the gallbladder.  Next, utilizing copious amounts of irrigation, the abdomen was irrigated.  A small liver cyst that have been identified upon initial aspiration was grasped with a grasper and utilizing electrocautery was completely excised off the left lobe of the liver.  This was also taken and sent off as specimen.  The abdomen was then copiously irrigated until clear irrigation was identified.  All laparoscopic ports were removed under direct visualization.

He presented now after informed consent for the above procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preanesthesia area, then taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position on the operating table, and induced under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities.  The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion.  Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine.  The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade.  The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision.  The right upper quadrant was well visualized.  The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions.  The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector.  Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp.  The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided.  The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided.  The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis.  Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear.  No active bleeding or oozing was seen.  All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place.  The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port.  The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology.  The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  The insufflation was allowed to escape.  The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures.  Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied.

The patient was then scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient's abdomen was explored.  There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding or masses.  The abdomen was otherwise within normal limits.  The gallbladder was easily visualized.  There was an intrahepatic gallbladder.  There was no evidence of any inflammatory change.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought into the operating suite.,After general endotracheal intubation, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Next, an infraumbilical incision was made with a #10 scalpel.  The skin was elevated with towel clips and a Veress needle was inserted.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg of pressure.  The Veress needle was removed and a #10 blade trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The laparoscope was then inserted through this #10 port and the abdomen was explored.  There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding.  The peritoneum was smooth.  The gallbladder was intrahepatic somewhat.  No evidence of any inflammatory change.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the abdomen.  Next, attention was made to placing the epigastric #10 port, which again was placed under direct visualization without difficulty.  The two #5 ports were placed, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior axillary line again in similar fashion under direct visualization.  The gallbladder was then grasped out at its fundus, elevated to patient's left shoulder.  Using a curved dissector, the cystic duct was identified and freed up circumferentially.  Next, an Endoclip was used to distal and proximal to the gallbladder, Endoshears were used in between to transect the cystic duct.  The cystic artery was transected in similar fashion.  Attention was next made in removing the gallbladder from the liver bed using electrobovie cautery and spatulated tip.  It was done without difficulty.

3506, Laparoscopic cholecystectomy., Gastroenterology, Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy - 1 ,"PROCEDURE:,:  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An #11 blade scalpel was used to make a small infraumbilical skin incision in the midline.  The fascia was elevated between two Ochsner clamps and then incised.  A figure-of-eight stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was placed through the fascial edges.  The 11-mm port without the trocar engaged was then placed into the abdomen.  A pneumoperitoneum was established.  After an adequate pneumoperitoneum had been established, the laparoscope was inserted.  Three additional ports were placed all under direct vision.  An 11-mm port was placed in the epigastric area.  Two 5-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and slightly rotated to the left.  The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly and laterally.  The infundibulum was retracted inferiorly and laterally.  Electrocautery was used to carefully begin dissection of the peritoneum down around the base of the gallbladder.  The triangle of Calot was carefully opened up.  The cystic duct was identified heading up into the base of the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was also identified within the triangle of Calot.  After the triangle of Calot had been carefully dissected, a clip was then placed high up on the cystic duct near its junction with the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was clipped twice proximally and once distally.  Scissors were then introduced and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct, and the cystic artery was divided.  An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained.  This revealed good flow through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct.  There was good flow into the duodenum without any filling defects.  The hepatic radicals were clearly visualized.  The cholangiocatheter was removed, and two clips were then placed distal to the ductotomy on the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was then divided using scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed up away from the liver bed using electrocautery.  The gallbladder was easily removed through the epigastric port site.  The liver bed was then irrigated and suctioned.  All dissection areas were inspected.  They were hemostatic.  There was not any bile leakage.  All clips were in place.  The right gutter up over the edge of the liver was likewise irrigated and suctioned until dry.  All ports were then removed under direct vision.  The abdominal cavity was allowed to deflate.  The fascia at the epigastric port site was closed with a stitch of 2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia at the umbilical port was closed by tying the previously placed stitch.  All skin incisions were then closed with subcuticular sutures of 4-0 Monocryl and 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was infiltrated into all port sites.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Inspection was made for any entry problems, and none were encountered.,After limited exploration, the gallbladder was then retracted superiorly and laterally, and the cystic duct was dissected out.  This was done with some difficulty due to the fibrosis around the cystic duct, but care was taken to avoid injury to the duct and to the common duct.  In this manner, the cystic duct and cystic artery were dissected out.  Care was taken to be sure that the duct that was identified went into the gallbladder and was the cystic duct.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were then doubly clipped and divided, taking care to avoid injury to the common duct.  The gallbladder was then dissected free from the gallbladder bed.  Again, the gallbladder was somewhat adherent to the gallbladder bed due to previous inflammatory reaction.  The gallbladder was dissected free from the gallbladder bed utilizing the endo shears and the cautery to control bleeding.

A CT scan of his abdomen showed evidence of appendicitis with perforation.  He was evaluated in the Emergency Department and placed on the appendicitis critical pathway for this acute appendicitis process.  He required several boluses of fluid for tachycardia and evidence of dehydration.,I met with Carlos' parents and talked to them about the diagnosis of appendicis and surgical risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options.  All their questions have been answered and they agree with the surgical plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient had acute perforated appendicitis with diffuse suppurative peritonitis including multiple intraloop abscesses and purulent debris in all quadrants of the abdomen including the perihepatic and subphrenic recesses as well.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  A Foley catheter was placed for decompression, and his abdomen was prepared and draped in a standard fashion.  A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated in the soft tissues around his umbilicus and in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant locations chosen for trocar insertion.  We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy as the procedure.  A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision was made and an open technique was used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia.  CO2 was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working ports were placed in areas that had been previously anesthetized.,There was a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesions between the omentum and adjacent surfaces of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum.  After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix.  In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix.  The base of the appendix was then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix was amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port.  I spent the next 10 minutes irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system.  When this was complete, the CO2 was released one final time and as much of the fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity as possible.  The umbilical fascia was closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incisions were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.

3515, Repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 14 mm Hemashield tube graft., Gastroenterology, Juxtarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.,ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.,OPERATIVE TIME:  Three hours.,ANESTHESIA TIME:  Four hours.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After thorough preoperative evaluation, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position and after placement of upper extremity IV access and radial A-line, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  A Foley catheter was placed and a right internal jugular central line was placed.  The chest, abdomen, both groin, and perineum were prepped widely with Betadine and draped as a sterile field with an Ioban drape.  A long midline incision from xiphoid to pubis was created with a scalpel and the abdomen was carefully entered.  A sterile Omni-Tract was introduced into the field to retract the abdominal wall and gentle exploration of the abdomen was performed.  With the exception of the vascular findings to be described, there were no apparent intra-abdominal abnormalities.,The transverse colon retracted superiorly.  The small bowel was wrapped in moist green towel and retracted in the right upper quadrant.  The posterior peritoneum overlying the aneurysm was scribed mobilizing the ligament of Treitz thoroughly ligating and dividing the inferior mesenteric vein.  Dissection continued superiorly to identify the left renal vein and the right and left inferior renal arteries.  The mid left renal artery was likewise identified.  The perirenal aorta was prepared for clamp superior to the inferior left renal artery.  During this portion of the dissection, the patient was given multiple small doses of intravenous mannitol to establish an osmotic diuresis.  The distal dissection was then completed exposing each common iliac artery.  The arteries were suitable for control.,The patient was then given 8000 units of intravenous sodium heparin and systemic anticoagulation verified by activated clotting time.  The aneurysm was repaired.,First, the common carotid arteries were controlled with atraumatic clamps.  The inferior left renal artery was controlled with a microvascular clamp and a straight aortic clamp was used to control the aorta superior to this renal artery.  The aneurysm was opened on the right anterior lateral aspect and an endarterectomy of the aneurysm sac was performed.  There was a high-grade stenosis at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and an eversion endarterectomy was performed at this site.  The vessel was controlled with a microvascular clamp.  Two pairs of lumbar arteries were oversewn with 2-0 silk.  A 14 mm Hemashield tube graft was selected and sewn end-to-end fashion to the proximal aorta using a semi continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  At the completion of anastomosis three patch stitches of 3-0 Prolene were required for hemostasis.  The graft was cut to appropriate length and sewn end-to-end at the iliac bifurcation using semi-continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  Prior to completion of this anastomosis, the graft was flushed of air and debris and blood flow was reestablished slowly to the distal native circulation first to the pelvis with external compression on the femoral vessels and finally to the distal native circulation.  The distal anastomosis was competent without leak.,The patient was then given 70 mg of intravenous protamine and final hemostasis obtained using electrocoagulation.  The back bleeding from the inferior mesenteric artery was assessed and was pulsatile and vigorous.  The colon was normal in appearance and this vessel was oversewn using 2-0 silk.  The aneurysm sac was then closed about the grafts snuggly using 3-0 PDS in a vest-over-pants fashion.  The posterior peritoneum was reapproximated using running 3-0 PDS.  The entire large and small bowel were inspected and these structures were well perfused with a strong pulse within the SMA normal appearance of the entire viscera.  The NG tube was positioned in the fundus of the stomach and the viscera returned to their anatomic location.  The midline fascia was then reapproximated using running #1 PDS suture.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with bacitracin and kanamycin solution.  The skin edges coapted using surgical staples.,At the conclusion of the case, sponge and needle counts were correct and a sterile occlusive compressive dressing was applied.","gastroenterology, inferior left renal artery, semi continuous prolene suture, juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, inferior mesenteric artery, continuous prolene suture, abdominal aortic aneurysm, hemashield tube, inferior mesenteric, renal artery, aortic aneurysm, aneurysm, iliac, endarterectomy, viscera, hemashield, abdomen, prolene, arteries, juxtarenal, graft, aortic, endotracheal, renal, artery, "

The risks of the procedure were explained.  She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery.  General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted.  The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion.  A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope.  Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum.  A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region.  The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized.  The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated.  I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix.  The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.  I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry.  One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line.  We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites.  The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture.  The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.  No complications.  Minimal blood loss.  Specimen is the appendix.

Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.", Gastroenterology, Ischemic Cecum - Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Pneumatosis coli in the cecum.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who was admitted on 10/27/07 with weakness and tiredness with aspiration pneumonia.  The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort.  In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic.  He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts.  In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Obtained from the medical chart.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Per his current medical chart.,ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago.  He does have chronic alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  A very thin white male who is dyspneic and having difficulty breathing at the moment.,VITAL SIGNS:  Afebrile.

Blood pressure 130s-150s/60s-70s.,NECK:  Soft and supple, full range of motion.,HEART:  Regular.,ABDOMEN:  Distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information.  He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.,DIAGNOSTICS: , A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.,ASSESSMENT: , Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.,PLAN: , The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago.  Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.  The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.  So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.","gastroenterology, ischemic cecum, metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, copd, anemia, gastric ulcer, pneumatosis coli, cecum, aspiration pneumonia, aspiration, ischemic, atrial, metastatic, hydronephrosis, fibrillation, pneumatosis, pneumonia, "

The patient underwent a colonoscopy which found this lesion and biopsies were taken proving invasive adenocarcinoma.  The patient was NG decompressed preoperatively and was prepared for surgery.  The need for removal of the colon cancer was explained at length.  The patient was agreeable to proceed with the surgery and signed preoperatively informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the Operative Suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department and NG and Foley catheters were placed preoperatively.  She was given triple antibiotics IV.  Due to her near obstructive symptoms, a formal ________ was not performed.,The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline laparotomy incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel and subcutaneous tissues were separated with electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal fascia.  Once divided, the intraabdominal cavity was accessed and bowel was protected as the rest of the abdominal wall was opened in the midline.  Extensive fluid was seen upon entering the abdomen, ascites fluid, which was clear straw-colored and this was sampled for cytology.  Next, the small bowel was retracted with digital exploration and there was a evidence of hepatic flexure, colonic mass, which was adherent to the surrounding tissues.  With mobilization of the colon along the line of Toldt down to the right gutter, the entire ileocecal region up to the transverse colon was mobilized into the field.  Next, a window was made 5 inches from the ileocecal valve and a GIA-75 was fired across the ileum.  Next, a second GIA device was fired across the proximal transverse colon, just sparring the middle colic artery.  The dissection was then carried down along the mesentry, down to the root of the mesentry.  Several lymph nodes were sampled carefully, and small radiopaque clips were applied along the base of the mesentry.  The mesentry vessels are hemostated and tied with #0-Vicryl suture sequentially, ligated in between.  Once this specimen was submitted to pathology, the wound was inspected.  There was no evidence of bleeding from any of the suture sites.  Next, a side-by-side anastomosis was performed between the transverse colon and the terminal ileum.  A third GIA-75 was fired side-by-side and GIA-55 was used to close the anastomosis.  A patent anastomosis was palpated.  The anastomosis was then protected with a #2-0 Vicryl #0-muscular suture.  Next, the mesenteric root was closed with a running #0-Vicryl suture to prevent any chance of internal hernia.  The suture sites were inspected and there was no evidence of leakage.  Next, the intraabdominal cavity was thoroughly irrigated with sterile saline and the anastomosis was carried into the right lower gutter.  Omentum was used to cover the intestines which appeared dilated and indurated from the near obstruction.  Next, the abdominal wall was reapproximated and the fascial layer using a two running loop PDS sutures meeting in the middle with good approximation of both the abdominal fascia.  Additional sterile saline was used to irrigate the subcutaneous fat and then the skin was closed with sequential sterile staples.,Sterile dressing was applied and the skin was cleansed and the patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the Operating Room and she was transferred to Recovery Room in stable condition and will be continued to be monitored on the Telemetry Floor with triple antibiotics and NG decompression.,","gastroenterology, colon tumor, ascites, adhesions, lysis of adhesions, exploratory laparotomy, colon cancer, transverse colon, hemicolectomy, laparotomy, "

Her swallowing mechanism does not appear to be very functional, and therefore, it was felt that in order to aid in her home care that she would be better served with a gastrostomy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in usual manner.  Transverse left upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The muscle was divided and the peritoneal cavity entered.  The greater curvature of the stomach was grasped with a Babcock clamp and brought into the operative field.  The site for gastrostomy was selected and a pursestring suture of #4-0 Nurolon placed in the gastric wall.  A 14-French 0.8 cm Mic-Key tubeless gastrostomy button was then placed into the stomach and the pursestring secured about the tube.  Following this, the stomach was returned to the abdominal cavity and the posterior fascia was closed using a #4-0 Nurolon affixing the stomach to the posterior fascia.  The anterior fascia was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue with the same, and the skin closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl.  The balloon was inflated to the full 5 mL.

He is taking it at a dose of 100 mg per day.  He is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years.  In fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. An x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  He thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  He has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  The patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  He has not had any rectal bleeding. He asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with IV insertion.  He has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  The tenderness has now completely resolved.  , ,He had a colonoscopy performed in August of 2003, by Dr. S.  An anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  Dr. S recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  No active Crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy.  , ,Earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  At that time he was taking a lot of Tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  Under Dr. S's recommendation, he stopped the Imuran for one month and reduced his dose of Tylenol.  Since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the Imuran with no problems.  , ,He also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.  It used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week.  He takes over-the-counter H2 blockers as needed, as well as Tums.

The patient emphatically states that he does not want to consider dilation at this time.  The patient is strongly encouraged to call us when he does experience any obstructive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits.  He states understanding of this. Advised to maintain low residue diet to avoid obstructions. ,2.  Continue with liver panel and ABC every month per Dr. S's instructions.,3.  Continue Imuran 100 mg per day.,4.  Continue to minimize Tylenol use.  The patient is wondering if he can take another type of medication for migraines that is not Tylenol or antiinflammatories or aspirin.  Dr. S is consulted and agrees that Imitrex is an acceptable alternative for migraine headaches since he does not have advanced liver disease. The patient will make an appointment with his primary care provider to discuss this further. ,5.  Reviewed the importance of prophylactic treatment of reflux-type symptoms.  Encouraged the patient to take over-the-counter H2 blockers on a daily basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.

The patient is not a great historian.  Most of the history is obtained through the old history and chart that the patient has with her.  According to what we can make out, she began experiencing nausea, vomiting, recurrent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain in 2001.  She was initially seen by Dr. A back in September 2001 for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  During those times, it was suspected that part of her symptoms may be secondary to biliary disease and underwent a cholecystectomy performed in Oregon by Dr.  A in August 2001.  It was assumed that this was caused by biliary dyskinesia.  Previous to that, an upper endoscopy was performed by Dr. B in July 2001 that showed to be mild gastritis secondary to anti-inflammatory use.  Postoperatively she continued to have nausea and vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain similar to her gallbladder pain in the past.",

Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.  Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.,The patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007.

Her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site.,The patient's exam today is excellent.  Her belly is soft and nontender.  All of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.  We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty.  The site of the gastrostomy is excellent.  There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy.  Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future.  If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well.,PLAN:  ,The patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy.  We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.","gastroenterology, decannulation, enteral feeding, feeding access, laparoscopic fundoplication, gastrostomy, airway, laryngotracheoplasty, laparoscopic, fundoplication, "

He is a pleasant gentleman with a history of Wilson's disease.  It has been treated with penicillamine.  He was diagnosed with this at age 14.  He was on his way to South Carolina for a trip when he developed shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest discomfort.  He went to the closest hospital that they were near in Randolph, North Carolina and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid rate.  He was admitted there and observed.  He converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and so he required no further interventions.  He was started on Lopressor, which he has tolerated well.  An echocardiogram was performed, which revealed mild-to-moderate left atrial enlargement.  Normal ejection fraction.  No other significant valvular abnormality.  He reported to physicians there that he had cirrhosis related to his Wilson's disease.  Therefore hepatologist was consulted.  There was a recommendation to avoid Coumadin secondary to his questionable significant liver disease, therefore he was placed on aspirin 325 mg once a day.,In discussion with Mr. A and review of his chart that I have available, it is unclear as to the status of his liver disease, however, he has never had a liver biopsy, so his diagnosis of cirrhosis that they were concerned about in North Carolina is in doubt.  His LFTs have remained normal and his copper level has been undetectable on his current dose of penicillamine.,I would appreciate your input into the long term management of his anticoagulation and also any recommendations you would have about rhythm control.  He is in normal sinus rhythm as of my evaluation of him on 06/12/2008.  He is tolerating his metoprolol and aspirin without any difficulty.  I guess the big question remains is what level of risk that is entailed by placing him on Coumadin therapy due to his potentially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and evidence of left atrial enlargement that would place him in increased risk of recurrent episodes.,I appreciate your input regarding this friendly gentleman.  His current medicines include penicillamine 250 mg p.o. four times a day, metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day, and aspirin 325 mg a day.,If you have any questions regarding his care, please feel free to call me to discuss his case.  Otherwise, I will look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation.  Thank you as always for your care of our patient.","neurology, atrial enlargement, wilson's disease, penicillamine,"

However, the chart indicates that she had recurrent TIAs x3 yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion.  She had also complained of blurred vision for several days.  She was brought to the emergency room last night, where she was noted to have a left carotid bruit and was felt to have recurrent TIAs.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , The patient is on Lanoxin, amoxicillin, Hydergine, Cardizem, Lasix, Micro-K and a salt-free diet.  ,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke or drink alcohol.,FINDINGS:  ,Admission CT scan of the head showed a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone, probably representing the benign osteochondroma seen on previous studies.  CBC was normal, aside from a hemoglobin of 11.2.  ECG showed atrial fibrillation.

Carotid pulses are full bilaterally, with left carotid bruit.  Neurologic exam shows cranial nerve function II through XII to be intact, save for some slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold.  Motor examination shows no drift of the outstretched arms.  There is no tremor or past-pointing.  Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin performed well bilaterally.  Motor showed intact neuromuscular tone, strength, and coordination in all limbs.  Reflexes 1+ and symmetrical, with bilateral plantar flexion, absent jaw jerk, no snout.  Sensory exam is intact to pinprick touch, vibration, position, temperature, and graphesthesia.,IMPRESSION: , Neurological examination is normal, aside from mild impairment of recent memory, slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, and left carotid bruit.  She also has atrial fibrillation, apparently chronic.  In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy.  In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation.  I will be happy to follow the patient with you.","neurology, atrial fibrillation, carotid bruit, slurred speech, numbness, calcified mass lesion, neurological examination, tias, carotid, benign,"

2768, Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty., Neurology, Suboccipital Craniectomy  ,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient with a large 3.5 cm acoustic neuroma.  The patient is having surgery for resection.  There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression.  The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.  The case took 12 hours.  This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room.  General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion.  After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area.  A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone.  Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.  The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum.  The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.  The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated.  Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick.  This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified.  The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.  Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly.  The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor.  There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared.  The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion.  This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  The brainstem was identified above the complex.  Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  The lateral pontine vein was maintained.  Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  There was no tumor remaining at this point.  I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  There was no bleeding.  The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.  A muscle plug was used over one area.  Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.  Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  The wound was then irrigated thoroughly.  O Vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.,The patient was extubated and taken to the ICU in stable condition.","neurology, suboccipital, craniectomy, microscope, cranioplasty, acoustic neuroma, cerebellar peduncle, nerve complex, brainstem, nurolon, cavitron, kerrison, leksell, lateral pontine vein, suboccipital craniectomy, nerve, tumor"

", Neurology, Status Epilepticus ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Status epilepticus.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 6-year-old male who is a former 27-week premature infant who suffered an intraventricular hemorrhage requiring shunt placement, and as a result, has developmental delay and left hemiparesis.  At baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences.  His speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten.  He ambulates independently, but falls often.  He has difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left.  Mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running.  He is being followed by Medical Therapy Unit and has also been seen in the past by Dr. X.  He has not received Botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy.,The patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt has done well.,The patient developed seizures about 2 years ago.  These occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side.  His events, however, always tend to be prolonged.  He has had seizures as long as an hour and a half.  He tends to require multiple medications to stop them.  He has been followed by Dr. Y and was started on Trileptal.  At one point, The patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures.  He was more recently placed on Topamax since March 2007.  His last seizures were in March and May respectively.  He is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.,The patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure.  His seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right.  Family administered Diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose.  They did not know they could repeat this dose.  EMS was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin.  His seizures stopped thereafter, since that time, he had gradually become more alert and is eating, and is nearly back to baseline.  He is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time, he is positive for a low-grade fever, he has had no signs of illness otherwise.  He does have some fevers after his prolonged seizures.  He denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  There is no numbness or loss of skills.  He has no rashes, arthritis or arthralgias.  He has no oropharyngeal complaints.  Visual or auditory complaints.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Also positive for some mild scoliosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives at home with mother, father, and 2 other siblings.  There are no ill contacts.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male, in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  His vital signs are stable and he is currently afebrile.,HEENT:  Atraumatic and normocephalic.  Oropharynx shows no lesions.,NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.,ABDOMEN:  Benign without organomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and will follow instructions.  His speech is very dysarthric and he tends to run his words together.  He is about 50% understandable at best.  He does put words and sentences together.  His cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  His extraocular movements are intact.  His visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  His face shows left facial weakness postictally.  His palate elevates midline.  Vision is intact bilaterally.  Tongue protrudes midline.,Motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline.  His left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight.  He has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects, shows exaggerated tremor/dysmetria.  Right upper extremity is much more on target.  His sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  When sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis.  He also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point.  Gait was not tested today.,IMPRESSION: , This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence.  I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance.  The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  He may benefit from Botox.,In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.  They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call EMS at any point during that time.  Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them.  Other medication options would include Keppra, Zonegran or Lamictal.,FOLLOWUP: , Followup has already been scheduled with Dr. Y in February and they will continue to keep that date for followup.",
2775, Diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy., Neurology, Rolandic Epilepsy ,"City, State,Dear Dr. Y:,I had the pleasure of seeing ABC today back in Neurology Clinic where he has been followed previously by Dr. Z.  His last visit was in June 2006, and he carries a diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy.  To review, his birth was unremarkable.  He is a second child born to a G3, P1 to 2 female.  He has had normal development, and is a bright child in 7th grade.  He began having seizures, however, at 9 years of age.  It is manifested typically as generalized tonic-clonic seizures upon awakening or falling into sleep.  He also had smaller spells with more focal convulsion and facial twitching.  His EEGs have shown a pattern consistent with benign rolandic epilepsy (central temporal sharp waves both of the right and left hemisphere).  Most recent EEG in May 2006 shows the same abnormalities.,ABC initially was placed on Tegretol, but developed symptoms of toxicity (hallucinations) on this medication, he was switched to Trileptal.  He has done very well taking 300 mg twice a day without any further seizures.  His last event was the day of his last EEG when he was sleep deprived and was off medication.  That was a convulsion lasting 5 minutes.  He has done well otherwise.  Parents deny that he has any problems with concentration.  He has not had any behavior issues.  He is an active child and participates in sports and some motocross activities.  He has one older sibling and he lives with his parents.  Father manages Turkey farm with foster farms.  Mother is an 8th grade teacher.,Family history is positive for a 3rd cousin, who has seizures, but the specific seizure type is not known.  There is no other relevant family history.,Review of systems is positive for right heel swelling and tenderness to palpation.  This is perhaps due to sports injury.  He has not sprained his ankle and does not have any specific acute injury around the time that this was noted.  He does also have some discomfort in the knees and ankles in the general sense with activities.  He has no rashes or any numbness, weakness or loss of skills.  He has no respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  He has no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal complaints.,Past medical history is otherwise unremarkable.,Other workup includes CT scan and MRI scan of the brain, which are both normal.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  His weight today is 80.6 pounds.  Height is 58-1/4 inches.  Blood pressure 113/66.  Head circumference 36.3 cm.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Oropharynx shows no lesions.  NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.  CHEST:  Clear auscultation.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  Benign without organomegaly.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented.  His cognitive skills appear normal for his age.  His speech is fluent and goal-directed.  He follows instructions well.  His cranial nerves reveal his pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  Face moves symmetrically with normal sensation.  Palate elevates midline.  Tongue protrudes midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  Motor exam reveals normal strength and tone.  Sensation intact to light touch and vibration.  His gait is nonataxic with normal heel-toe and tandem.  Finger-to-nose, finger-nose-finger, rapid altering movements are normal.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.,IMPRESSION:  ,This is an 11-year-old male with benign rolandic epilepsy, who is followed over the past 2 years in our clinic.  Most recent electroencephalogram still shows abnormalities, but it has not been done since May 2006.  The plan at this time is to repeat his electroencephalogram, follow his electroencephalogram annually until it reveres to normal.  At that time, he will be tapered off of medication.  I anticipate at some point in the near future, within about a year or so, he will actually be taken off medication.  For now, I will continue on Trileptal 300 mg twice a day, which is a low starting dose for him.  There is no indication that his dose needs to be increased.  Family understands the plan.  We will try to obtain an electroencephalogram in the near future in Modesto and followup is scheduled for 6 months.  Parents will contact us after the electroencephalogram is done so they can get the results.,Thank you very much for allowing me to access ABC for further management.","neurology, tonic-clonic seizures, benign rolandic epilepsy, rolandic epilepsy, epilepsy, seizures, electroencephalogram,"
2776, Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities., Neurology, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy - Letter ,"Doctor's Address,Dear Doctor:,This letter serves as a reintroduction of my patient, A, who will be seeing you on Thursday, 06/12/2008.  As you know, he is an unfortunate gentleman who has reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities.  His current symptoms are more severe on the right and he has had a persisting wound that has failed to heal on his right leg.  He has been through Wound Clinic to try to help heal this, but was intolerant of compression dressings and was unable to get satisfactory healing of this.  He has been seen by Dr. X for his pain management and was considered for the possibility of amputation being a therapeutic option to help reduce his pain.  He was seen by Dr. Y at Orthopedic Associates for review of this.  However, in my discussion with Dr. Z and his evaluation of Mr. A, it was felt that this may be an imprudent path to take given the lack of likelihood of reduction of his pain from his RST, his questionable healing of his wound given noninvasive studies that did reveal tenuous oxygenation of the right lower leg, and concerns of worsening of his RST symptoms on his left leg if he would have an amputation.  Based on the results of his transcutaneous oxygen levels and his dramatic improvement with oxygen therapy at this test, Dr. Z felt that a course of hyperbaric oxygen may be of utility to help in improving his wounds.  As you may or may not know we have certainly pursued aggressive significant measures to try to improve Mr. A's pain.  He has been to Cleveland Clinic for implantable stimulator, which was unsuccessful at dramatically improving his pain.  He currently is taking methadone up to eight tablets four times a day, morphine up to 100 mg three times a day, and Dilaudid two tablets by mouth every two hours to help reduce his pain.  He also is currently taking Neurontin 1600 mg three times a day, Effexor XR 250 mg once a day, Cytomel 25 mcg once a day, Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q. day, levothyroxine 300 mcg p.o. q. day, Prinivil 20 mg p.o. q. day, and Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q day.,I appreciate your assistance in determining if hyperbaric oxygen is a reasonable treatment course for this unfortunate situation.  Dr. Z and I have both tried to stress the fact that amputation may be an abrupt and irreversible treatment course that may not reach any significant conclusion.  He has been evaluated by Dr. X for rehab concerns to determine.  He agrees that a less aggressive form of therapy may be most appropriate.,I thank you kindly for your prompt evaluation of this kind gentleman in an unfortunate situation.  If you have any questions regarding his care please feel free to call me at my office.  Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you shortly after your evaluation.  Please feel free to call me if it is possible or if you have any questions about anything.","neurology, rsd, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, orthopedic, oxygenationNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

I had last seen her on 06/21/07.,At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy.  She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07.  At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI.  I did not have any recent images.  I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.,She states that her symptoms are unchanged.  She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y.,She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist.  She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note.  No significant right upper extremity symptoms.  No bowel, bladder dysfunction.  No difficulty with ambulation.,FINDINGS: , On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities.  Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus.  Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally.  Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities.  Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder.,An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity.,Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed.  It is relatively limited study due to artifact.  He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change.  There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.,I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery.  With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with.  I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections.  The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.,I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine.,I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks.","neurology, upper extremity, radiculopathy, rotator cuff repair, cervical spinal stenosis, rotator cuff tear, physical examination, cuff, impingement, stenosis, extremity, surgery, tear, shoulder, rotator, cervical,"

2779, Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma.  Endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus., Neurology, Pituitary Adenomectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma, endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus, harvesting of dermal fascia abdominal fat graft, placement of abdominal fat graft into sella turcica, reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm, repair of nasal septal deviation, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique, and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This man has undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resections of his tumor, which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma.  He did not return for followup or radiotherapy as instructed, and the tumor has regrown.  For this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove as much tumor as possible.  The high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory was made clear to him.  Many risks including CSF leak and blindness were discussed in detail.  After clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The back was prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.,A 14-gauge Tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space.  Clear and colorless CSF issued forth.  A catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle was removed.  The catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.,This no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas.  Via injections through the lumbar drain, one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor.  This improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.,The patient was then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest was affixed.  He was placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The fluoroscope C-arm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection.  The metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope.  The oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the abdominal region, and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was carefully closed in layers.,I then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril.  The middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.  Needle Bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium.  The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid.  I entered into the sphenoid.,There was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and I slowly and carefully worked through all this.  I identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which was very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which I exposed the very medial portion of.  The opening was wide until I had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.,The operating microscope was then utilized.  Working under magnification, I used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.,The dura was then carefully opened in the midline, and I immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma.  A frozen section was obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features.,Slowly and meticulously, I worked to remove the tumor.  I used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free.  The tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic.,Slowly and carefully, I systematically entered the sellar contents until I could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right.  There appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left.  It was consistent with what we saw on the MRI imaging.,The portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter.  A large amount of this was removed.  There was a CSF leak, as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.,Under high magnification, I actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor.  While there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus.  In fact, I reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well.,I reasoned that I had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression.  Attention was therefore turned to closure.,The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  I asked Anesthesiology to perform a Valsalva maneuver, and there was no evidence of bleeding.,Attention was turned to closure and reconstruction.  I placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air.  Using a polypropylene insert, I reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm.,DuraSeal was placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and DuraSeal.,I inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation.  The middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position.  There was no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open nasal packing was required.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct, and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of tumor.",

2783," The patient with pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema, comes in because of new onset of headaches. ", Neurology, Pseudotumor Cerebri ,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 38-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema who comes in because of new onset of headaches.  She comes to clinic by herself.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Dr. X has cared for her since 2002.  She has a Codman-Hakim shunt set at 90 mmH2O.  She last saw us in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.  We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She states that since that time her headaches have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She has not been able to sleep.  She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.  She reports no nausea at this time.  She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well.  She tells me that she has an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.  She reports no other complaints at this time.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  On examination today, this is a pleasant 38-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area without difficulty.  She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 153/86, pulse 63, and respiratory rate 16.,Cranial Nerves:  Intact for extraocular movements.  Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movements are all intact.  I did not know any papilledema on exam bilaterally.,I examined her shut site, which is clean, dry, and intact.  She did have a small 3 mm to 4 mm round scab, which was noted farther down from her shunt reservoir.  It looks like there is a little bit of dry blood there.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient appears to have had worsening headaches since shunt adjustment back after an MRI.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema.,2.  Migraine headaches.,PROCEDURES:,  I programmed her shunt to 90 mmH2O.,PLAN:,  It was noted that the patient began to have an acute onset of headache pain after her shunt adjustment approximately a week and a half ago.  I had programmed her shunt back to 90 mmH2O at that time and confirmed it with an x-ray.  However, the picture of the x-ray was not the most desirable picture.  Thus, I decided to reprogram the shunt back to 90 mmH2O today and have the patient return to Sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90.  In addition, she told me that she is scheduled to see Dr. Y tomorrow, so she should followup with him and also plan on contacting the Wilmer Eye Institute to setup an appointment.  She should followup with the Wilmer Eye Institute as she is complaining of blurry vision and dimming of the lights occasionally.,Total visit time was approximately 60 minutes and about 10 minutes of that time was spent in counseling the patient.","neurology, migraine headaches, pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema, onset of headaches, blurry vision, shunt adjustment, pseudotumor cerebri, headaches, pseudotumor, cerebri, papilledema"

General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion.  The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen.  The neck was prepped as well.  After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl.  A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle.  After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible.  The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared.  The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out.  The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen.  The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen.  The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis.  A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use.  I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb.  It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube.  The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made.  I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion.  Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy.  For details, please see his operative note.,After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap.  A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm.  The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath.  Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle.  The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin.  The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction.  The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion.  The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel.  The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges.  The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck.  The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique.  Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes.  Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well.  There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case.  The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax.  The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl.  I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place.  The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with skin staples.  There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself.  The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.,The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples.  The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened.  The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well.","neurology, rectus abdominis myocutaneous, skull base defect, squamous cell carcinoma, skull base, squamous cell, rectus sheath, abdominis, muscle, rectus, sheath"

She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the ""early stages of a likely dementia"" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began ""as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was ""too derogatory.""  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated ""diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.""  It concluded that ""results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy…  The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot ""like dragging.""  Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.

In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.

Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.", Neurology, Neuropsychological Evaluation - 3 ,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney.  He was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: , Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: , The patient was brought to the Hospital Emergency Department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  He has no recollection of the event.  The following information is obtained from his medical record.  On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times ""I do not feel well"" and looked ""glazed.""  He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  She thought he was warm and had chills.  He later returned to his baseline.  He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  The patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  He was hospitalized at Hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative EEG, MRI showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  He was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.,In 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an MRI at that time which showed some small vessel changes.,During this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  He thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  When I asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he ""felt fine the whole time.""  He appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  So, The patient reported some age related ""memory lapses"" such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  However, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  He denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  He does not have to recheck information for errors.  He is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  He reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  He said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  He reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  He did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  He remains completely independent in his ADLs.  He denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  He is also able to handle their finances.  He did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Includes coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by Dr. Y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.  Note that due to back pain, he had been taking Percocet daily prior to his hospitalization.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, Vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, Coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener.  Note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking Lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , Surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  The patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  He quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  He denied any illicit drug use.  Please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  He also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient's sleep deprived EEG was recommended.,MRI completed on 09/30/09 showed ""mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated June 15, 2007.  No evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  CT scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  EEG was negative.  Deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  Note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:, Reportedly significant for TIAs in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.

Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has undergone no surgical procedures.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.,General:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.,HEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.,Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.,Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.,Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.,Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.,Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then.",

A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess neuropsychological factors, clarify areas of strength and weakness, and to assist in therapeutic program planning in light of episodes of syncope.,BRIEF SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:,RELEVANT HISTORY:,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and an interview with ,the patient.,The patient presented to Dr. X on August 05, 2008 as she had been recently hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope.  She was referred to Dr. X for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope.  The patient reports an extensive neurological history.  Her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  In spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved ""honors in school"" and ""looked smart.""  She reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  At 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  She reported that she will frequently ""bang her head against the wall"" to relieve the pain.  The patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.  At 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches.  She reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and ""thrown two and a half city blocks.""  The patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  She reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  Her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  In 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  Following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  These episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.,The patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.  She reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused.  These episodes diminished from 2002 to June 2008.

A second episode occurred on July 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  She was admitted to Sinai Hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  Her EEG and head CT were considered to be completely normal.  She did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour EEG.  She reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized.  She stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and ""tunnel vision"" (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was ""spazzing out"" on the floor.  During these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding.,The patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old.  She reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of Jack Daniel.  She stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt.  In 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication.  At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself.  The patient's medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.,The patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory.  She reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes.  She finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential.  She experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform.  She reported that she had a photographic memory for directions.

2793, Patient demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment for stroke., Neurology, Neuropsychological Evaluation ,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt ""just like the stroke.""  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it ""every other night.""  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  Her father has gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity.,She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing.  As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  She is now living on her own.  She has never driven.  She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning.  She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  She has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  She reported that this only ""comes and goes."",TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II),  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test",

2795, Sample for Neuropsychological Evaluation, Neurology, Neuropsychological Evaluation - 1 ,"REASON FOR EVALUATION: , The patient is a 37-year-old white single male admitted to the hospital through the emergency room.  I had seen him the day before in my office and recommended him to go into the hospital.  He had just come from a trip to Taho in Nevada and he became homicidal while there.  He started having thoughts about killing his mother.  He became quite frightened by that thought and called me during the weekend we were able to see him on that Tuesday after talking to him.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a patient that has been suffering from a chronic psychotic condition now for a number of years.  He began to have symptoms when he was approximately 18 or 19 with auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions.  He was using drugs and smoking marijuana at that time has experimenting with LXV and another drugs too.  The patient has not used any drugs since age 25.  However, he has continued having intense and frequent psychotic bouts.  I have seen him now for approximately one year.  He has been quite refractory to treatment.  We tried different types of combination of medications, which have included Clozaril, Risperdal, lithium, and Depakote with partial response and usually temporary.  The patient has had starting with probably has had some temporary relief of the symptoms and they usually do not last more than a few days.  The dosages that we have used have been very high.  He has been on Clozaril 1200 mg combined with Risperdal up to 9 mg and lithium at a therapeutic level.  However, he has not responded.,He has delusions of antichrist.  He strongly believes that the dogs have a home in the neighborhood are communicating with him and criticizing him and he believes that all the people can communicate to him with telepathy including the animals.  He has paranoid delusions.  He also gets homicidal like prior to this admission.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  As mentioned before, this patient has been psychotic off and on for about 20 years now.  He has had years in which he did better on Clozaril and also his other medications.,With typical anti-psychotics, he has done well at times, but he eventually gets another psychotic bout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has a history of obesity and also of diabetes mellitus.  However, most recently, he has not been treated for diabetes since his last regular weight since he stopped taking Zyprexa.  The patient has chronic bronchitis.  He smokes cigarettes constantly up to 60 a day.,DRUG HISTORY:,  He stopped using drugs when he was 25.  He has got a lapse, but he was more than 10 years and he has been clean ever since then.  As mentioned before, he smokes cigarettes quite heavily and which has been a problem for his health since he also has chronic bronchitis.,PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS: , The patient lives with his mother and has been staying with her for a few years now.

2796," Approximately one and a half years ago, patient fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.", Neurology, Neurologic Consultation - 5 ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal.,He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Pneumonia.  He has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which started at approximately age 20.  These have been treated repeatedly over the years, and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years, although this has been far more frequent in the past year.  He is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged.  There is no known history of bronchiectasis, inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia.,2.  He has had a catheter placed for urinary retention, his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement.  The patient does not have any history of diabetes and does not report any other medical problems.  He has lost approximately 18 pounds in the past month.,3.  He had an appendectomy in the 1940s.,4.

His pain score was 0.,APPEARANCE:  No acute distress.  He is pleasant and well-groomed.,HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  No carotid bruits appreciated.,LUNGS:  There were few coarse crackles in both lung bases.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Revealed a normal first and second heart sound, with no third or fourth heart sound and no murmurs.  The pulse was regular and of normal volume.,ABDOMEN:  Soft with no masses and normal bowel sounds.  There were no carotid bruits.,EXTREMITIES:  No contractures appreciated.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:,MSE:  His orientation, language, calculations, 100-7 tests were all normal.  There was atrophy and fasciculations in both the arms and legs.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerve examination was normal with the exception that there was some mild atrophy of his tongue and possible fasciculations.  His palatal movement was normal and gag reflex was normal.,MOTOR:  Strength was decreased in all muscle groups as follows:  Deltoid 4/4, biceps 4+/4+, triceps 5/5, wrist extensors 4+/4+, finger extensors 4-/4-, finger flexors 4-/4-, interossei 4-/4-, hip flexors 4+/4+, hip extensors 4+/4+, knee extensors 4/4, and knee flexors 4/4.  Foot dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, toe extension and toe flexion was all 0 to 1.  There was atrophy in both hands and general atrophy of the lower limb muscles.  The feet were both cold and showed dystrophic features.  Fasciculations were present mainly in the hands.  There was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand.,REFLEXES:  Reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs.  The jaw reflex was 2+.  Vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers.  Vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee.  Joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers.  Pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs.  Pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows.  The same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing.,COORDINATION:  Coordination was barely normal in the right hand.  Rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand.  The patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, Romberg's test and balance could not be assessed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , Previous diagnostic studies and patient reports.  There were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed.  A previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in October 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate.  An x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.  A CTA of the neck with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis.  The posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis.  There was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted.  An MRI of the brain with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration.  There was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis.  This was an essentially normal brain MRI.  A CBC performed in January 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated MCH of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal.  An electrolyte study performed in January 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1.  The glucose was 86.  TSH performed in January 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range.  Vitamin B12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal.  A myocardial stress study performed in December 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with Persantine Cardiolite SPECT.  The ECG was non-diagnostic.  There was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males.  A CT of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in December 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5.  At L5-S1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis.  There was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at L1-L4.  An echocardiogram was performed in November 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings.  He is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities.  His proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia.  According to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since July 2008.  As indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and EMG test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy.  There was no involvement of the tongue on EMG.  The laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy.  We are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the Mayo Clinic.  This type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as SLE, Sjogren's, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease.  In addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents.  The patient did not receive any of these.  It may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking.  We have requested that he obtain a CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in Acute Rehabilitation.  The verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer.  We did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.  The patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm.  This showed evidence of severe axonal loss.  There was no evidence of a vasculitis.  The vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis.  There were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections.  The muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping.  Again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis.  Evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy.  Specifically, there is no history of HIV exposure.  We would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis.  At this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed.  I have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son.  We also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy.  I think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder.,There is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.  However, since I have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, I cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this.,PLAN:,1.  Nerve conduction and EMG will be performed today.  The results were indicated above.,2.  The following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, CBC, thyroid function tests, B12, ANA, C-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded DNA antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin A1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the Mayo Clinic, B12.  These studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7.  The B12 was greater than 2000.  The immunoelectrophoresis, ANA, double-stranded DNA, ANCA, hemoglobin A1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, C-reactive protein were all normal or negative.  The B12 level was greater than 2000.  Liver function tests were normal.  The glucose was 90.  ESR was 10.  Hemoglobin A1c was 5.5.,3.  A left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above.,4.  CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis.,5.  Whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.,6.  The patient will go to the Rehabilitation Facility for Acute Rehabilitation and Training.,7.  We have not made any changes to his medication.  He does have some mild orthostatic changes; however, he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day.  Usually, he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day.,8.  Followup will be as determined by the family.",

", Neurology, Neurologic Consultation - 4 ,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION:,  Muscle twitching, clumsiness, progressive pain syndrome, and gait disturbance.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 62-year-old African-American male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two MIs, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  He does not have any tremor.  He denies any neck pain.  He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait.,Recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.  About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  At that facility, his insulin was stopped.  Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  He denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, arthritis, GERD, and headaches.,MEDICATIONS: , Trazodone, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, Prevacid, lisinopril, glipizide, and gabapentin.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Discussed above and documented on the chart.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Discussed above and documented on the chart.

Motor examination reveals mild atrophy in bilateral FDIs, but still has a strong grip.  Individual muscle strength is close to normal with only subtle weakness found in ankle plantar and dorsiflexion.  Tone and bulk are normal.  Sensory examination reveals a severe decrease to all modalities in his lower extremities from just above the knees distally.  He has no vibration sense at his knees.  Similarly, there is decrease to all sensory modalities in his both upper extremities from just above the wrist distally.  The only reflexes I could obtain with trace reflexes in his biceps.  Remaining reflexes were unelicitable.  No Babinski.  The patient walks normally with the aid of a cane.  He has severe sensory ataxia with inability to walk unaided.  Positive Romberg with eyes open and closed.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,1.  Probable painful diabetic neuropathy.  Symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities.  He has relative preservation of motor function.  Because these symptoms are progressive and, by report, he came off his insulin, suggesting somewhat mild diabetes, I would like to rule out other causes of progressive neuropathy.,2.  He has history of myoclonic jerks.  I did not see any on my examination today and I feel that these are benign and probably secondary to his severe insomnia, which he states is secondary to the painful neuropathy.  I would like to rule out other causes such as hepatic encephalopathy., ,I have recommended the following:,1.  EMG/nerve conduction study to assess severity of neuropathy and to characterize neuropathy.,2.  Blood work, looking for other causes of neuropathy and myoclonus, to include CBC, CMP, TSH, LFT, B12, RPR, ESR, Lyme titer, and HbA1c, and ammonia level.,3.  Neurontin and oxycodone have not been effective, and I have recommended Cymbalta starting at 30 mg q.d. for five days and then increasing to 60 mg q.d.  Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.,4.  I have explained to him that progression of diabetic neuropathy is closely related to diabetic control and I have recommended tight diabetic control.,5.  I will see him at followup at the EMG.",

2799," The patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness. ", Neurology, Neuropsychological Evaluation - 5 ,"PROBLEMS AND ISSUES:,1.  Headaches, nausea, and dizziness, consistent with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, recommend amitriptyline for prophylactic treatment and Motrin for abortive treatment.,2.  Some degree of peripheral neuropathy, consistent with diabetic neuropathy, encouraged her to watch her diet and exercise daily.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness.  I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination.  I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today.  I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her.,Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had ""zig-zag lines"" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ,Her past medical history is significant for injury to her left shoulder, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, diabetes, anxiety, and osteoporosis.,MEDICATIONS:,  Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, glipizide, metformin, vitamin D, Centrum multivitamin tablets, Actos, lorazepam as needed, Vytorin, and Celexa.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,There is family history of migraine and diabetes in her siblings.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She drinks alcohol occasionally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Her review of systems was significant for headaches, pain in her left shoulder, sleeping problems and gastroesophageal reflex symptoms.  Remainder of her full 14-point review of system was unremarkable.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On examination, the patient was pleasant.  She was able to speak English fairly well.  Her blood pressure was 130/84.  Heart rate was 80.  Respiratory rate was 16.  Her weight was 188 pounds.  Her pain score was 0/10.  Her general exam was completely unremarkable.  Her neurological examination showed subtle weakness in her left arm due to discomfort and pain.  She had reduced vibration sensation in her left ankle and to some degree in her right foot.  There was no ataxia.  She was able to walk normally.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.,She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X's was unremarkable.  She reports that she had a brain MRI two years ago which was also unremarkable.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who has had episodes of headaches with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s.  She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms.  Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine.  I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, Ménière's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.,I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet.  I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine.  I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit.  I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time.  She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches.,She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms.  I encouraged her to walk daily in order to improve her fitness, which helps to reduce migraine symptoms.","neurology, nausea, dizziness, migraine, peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, neuropathy, positional vertigo, photophobia and dizziness, neurology consultation, tunnel vision, vestibular migraine, migraine symptoms, headaches, photophobia, ataxia, "
2800, Neurologic consultation was requested to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy., Neurology, Neurologic Consultation ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Neurologic consultation was requested by Dr. X to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is well known to me.  She has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  She also has a history of factor V Leiden deficiency.  She was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  At that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her Trileptal dose if seizures continue.  She did well on 2 mL twice a day without any sedation.  This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  Diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.  Her Trileptal dose was increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.,According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal.  She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  Reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room.  She still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  When she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  She is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished.  She has also been less feisty as her usual sounds.  She has been seizure free since her admission.,LABORATORY DATA: , Pertinent labs obtained here showed the following:  CRP is less than 0.3, CMP normal, and CBC within normal limits.  CSF cultures so far is negative.  Dr. Limon's note refers to a CSF, white blood cell count of 2, 1 RBC, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  There are no imaging studies in the computer.  I believe that this may have been done at Kaweah Delta Hospital and reviewed by Dr. X, who indicated that there was no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Trileptal 180 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n., acetaminophen, and azithromycin.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient was asleep, but easily aroused.  There was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  She eventually started crying and became agitated.  She made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward.  Fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.,HEENT:  She was obviously visually impaired.  Pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.,EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.  There was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  IV was noted on the left hand.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded.,I concur with Dr. X's recommendations.  I do not recommend any changes in Trileptal for now.  I will be available while she remains hospitalized.,","neurology, lethargy, encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, shunted hydrocephalus, seizure breakthrough, shunt malfunction, neurologic consultation, neurologic, seizure, trileptal"

It was felt to be stage 2.  It was not N-Myc amplified and had favorable Shimada histology.  In followup, he was found to have a second primary in his right adrenal gland, which was biopsied and also consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology.  He is now being treated with chemotherapy per protocol P9641 and not on study.  He last received chemotherapy on 05/21/07, with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.  He received G-CSF daily after his chemotherapy due to neutropenia that delayed his second cycle.  In the interval since he was last seen, his mother reports that he had a couple of days of nasal congestion, but it is now improving.  He is not acted ill or had any fevers.  He has had somewhat diminished appetite, but it seems to be improving now.  He is peeing and pooping normally and has not had any diarrhea.  He did not have any appreciated nausea or vomiting.

2802," Patient has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.", Neurology, Neurologic Consultation - 2 ,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.,According to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  He started to shuffle.  He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006.  At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  He has not fallen in the last month.  He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  His family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.,In regard to the bladder, he states, ""I wet the bed.""  In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  This was treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence.  The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.,He has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.,In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  His wife took over his medications about two years ago.  She stopped his driving about three years ago.  She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  Apparently, he did not object.  At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  He needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  He is a retired office machine repairman.  He is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.,He has not had PT or OT and has not been treated with medications for Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  He has been treated for the bladder.  He has not had lumbar puncture.,Past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that I reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  The bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively.  He has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  He had a period of depression in 1999 and was on Prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  He used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  This was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  She states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,He quit smoking in 1968.  His current weight is 183 pounds.  His tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,His grandfather had arthritis.  His father had Parkinson's disease.  His mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes.,He does not have a Living Will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself.,REVIEW OF HYDROCEPHALUS RISK FACTORS: , None.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Metformin 500 mg three times a day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, Uroxatral 10 mg per day, Detrol LA 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  His weight is 180 pounds.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The head circumference is 59 cm, which is the ,75-90th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm.,Spine:  The spine is straight and not tender.  I can easily palpate the spinous processes.  There is no scoliosis.,Skin:  No neurocutaneous stigmata.,Cardiovascular Examination:  No carotid or vertebral bruits.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 17/30.  He did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  There was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  He could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  No evidence of papilledema.  The pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  There is tremulousness of the outstretched hands.,Sensory Exam:  Is difficult to interpret.  Either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing.,Cerebellar Exam:  Is intact for finger-to-nose, heel-to-knee, and rapid alternating movement tests.  There is no dysarthria.,Reflexes:  Trace in the arms, 2+ at the knees, and 0 at the ankles.  It is not certain whether there is a Babinski sign or simply withdrawal.,Gait:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 7-10/16 and a gait score of 2-5/12 for a total score of 9-15/28, which is significantly impaired.,REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the MRI scan of the brain from December 11, 2007 at Advanced Radiology.  It shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  The 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  The span is enlarged at 12 mm.  The sylvian aqueduct is patent.  There is a pulsation artifact.  The corpus callosum is effaced.  There are extensive T2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata.  There are also scattered T2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia.  There is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  There is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  His examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment.  His MRI scan raises the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 & 438).,3.  Gait impairment (781.2).,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).,5.  Dementia.,6.  Hypertension.,7.  Hypercholesterolemia.",
2803, The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness., Neurology, Neuro Consult - Leg Weakness ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago.,He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.,In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia.  He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents.  He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing.  He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it.  He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.  He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon., ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix.  , ,ALLERGIES:,  He has no known drug allergies., ,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He lives with his wife.  He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering.  He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting.  He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night.  Prior to that, he drank significantly more.  He denies illicit drug use.  He was athletic growing up., ,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His mother died of complications from heart disease.  His father died of heart disease in his 40s.  He has two living brothers.  One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history.  The other is apparently healthy.  He has one healthy child.  His maternal uncles apparently had polio.  When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  He is fairly certain that they had polio.  He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has occasional tinnitus.  He has difficulty sleeping.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, ,Vital Signs:",
2804, Neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with seizure medication., Neurology, Neurologic Consultation - 3 ,"HISTORY: , Neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with her seizure medication.  The patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy.  She had been previously followed by XYZ, but has been under the care of the UCSF epilepsy program and recently by Dr. Y.  I reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at CHCC and also interviewed mom.,The patient had seizure breakthrough in August 2007, which requires inpatient admission, Thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early December.  She remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with Diastat.  She presented to our ER today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of Diastat at home.  Mom documented 103 temperature at home.  In the ER, this was 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.  I reviewed the ER notes.  At 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5.  UCSF fellow was contacted.  She was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered.  Vital weight was 27.  Seizures apparently had stopped.  The valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79.  According to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose.  Other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal CMP.,Previous workup here showed an EEG on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus.  MRI on June 2007 and January 2005 were within normal limits.  Mom describes the following seizure types:,1.  Eye blinking with unresponsiveness.,2.  Staring off to one side.,3.  Focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure.,She also said that she was supposed to see Dr. Y this Friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available.  She was being to physicians' care as Dr. Z had previously being following her last UCSF.,She had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs.  These include Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  These are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these.  Actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension.,She also had been treated with Clobazam.  Her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and Tranxene.  Other attempts to taper Topamax, but this resulted increased seizures.  She also has oligohidrosis during this summertime.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Include Diastat 20 mg; Topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; Tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; Depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 15 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.,NECK:  Supple.,NEUROLOGICAL:  She had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed.,She was able to follow commands such as when I request that she gave mom a kiss.  She acknowledged her doll.  Left fundus is sharp.  She resisted the rest of the exam.  There was no obvious lateralized findings.,ASSESSMENT:,  Status epilepticus resolved.  Triggered by a febrile illness, possibly viral.  Refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy.,IMPRESSION: , I discussed the maximizing Depakote to mom and she concurred.  I recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning, one in the day, and two at bedtime.  For today, she did give an IV Depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued IV until she is taking p.o.  Dr. X agreed with the changes and orders were written for this.  She can continue her current doses of Topamax and Tranxene.  This can be given by NG if needed.  Topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.  I will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization.  Mom will call contact Dr. Y an update him about the recent changes.","neurology, eye blinking, status epilepticus, seizure medication, valproic acid, allergic reactions, neurologic consultation, seizure, neurologic, seizures,"
2805, Patient with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and recent generalized tonic-clonic seizure., Neurology, Myoclonic Epilepsy ,"DIAGNOSES:,1.  Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.,2.  Recent generalized tonic-clonic seizure.,MEDICATIONS:,1.  Lamictal 250 mg b.i.d.,2.  Depo-Provera.,INTERIM HISTORY: , The patient returns for followup.  Since last consultation she has tolerated Lamictal well, but she has had a recurrence of her myoclonic jerking.  She has not had a generalized seizure.  She is very concerned that this will occur.  Most of the myoclonus is in the mornings.  Recent EEG did show polyspike and slow wave complexes bilaterally, more prominent on the left.  She states that she has been very compliant with the medications and is getting a good amount of sleep.  She continues to drive.,Social history and review of systems are discussed above and documented on the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Vital signs are normal.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  There is no nystagmus.  Visual fields are full.  Demeanor is normal.  Facial sensation and symmetry is normal.  No myoclonic jerks noted during this examination.  No myoclonic jerks provoked by tapping on her upper extremity muscles.  Negative orbit.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and symmetric.  Gait is normal.  Tandem gait is normal.  Romberg negative.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  Recurrence of early morning myoclonus despite high levels of Lamictal.  She is tolerating the medication well and has not had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  She is concerned that this is a precursor for another generalized seizure.  She states that she is compliant with her medications and has had a normal sleep-wake cycle.,Looking back through her notes, she initially responded very well to Keppra, but did have a breakthrough seizure on Keppra.  This was thought secondary to severe insomnia when her baby was very young.  Because she tolerated the medication well and it was at least partially affective, I have recommended adding Keppra 500 mg b.i.d.  Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.,I will see in followup in three months.","neurology, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, tonic clonic seizure, myoclonic epilepsy, tonic clonic, juvenile, myoclonus, epilepsy, myoclonic, seizure"

The gait does not have significant slapping characteristics.  Sensory examination is largely unremarkable.  Heart, lungs, and abdomen are within normal limits.,IMPRESSION: , Mr. ABC is doing about the same.  We discussed the issue of adherence to Copaxone.  In order to facilitate this, I would like him to take Copaxone every other day, but on a regular rhythm.  His wife continues to inject him.  He has not been able to start himself on the injections.,Greater than 50% of this 40-minute appointment was devoted to counseling.","neurology, neurologic consultation, stamina, preponderance, neurologic, consultation, copaxone,"
2807, , Neurology, Neuro Consult - Depression & Dementia ,"Subsequently, the patient developed a moderately severe depression.  She was tried on various medications, which caused sweating, nightmares and perhaps other side effects.  She was finally put on Effexor 25 mg two tablets h.s. and trazodone 100 mg h.s., and has done fairly well, although she still has significant depression.,Her daughter brought her in today to be sure that she does not have dementia.  There is no history of memory loss.  There is no history of focal neurologic symptoms or significant headaches.,The patient's complaints, according to the daughter, include not wanted to go out in public, shamed regarding her appearance (25-pound weight loss over the past year), eating poorly, not doing things unless asked, hiding food to prevent having to eat it, nervousness, and not taking a shower.  She has no focal neurologic deficits.  She does complain of constipation.  She has severe sleep maintenance insomnia and often sleeps only 2 hours before awakening frequently for the rest of the night.,The patient was apparently visiting her daughter in northern California in December 2003.  She was taken to her daughter's primary care physician.  She underwent vitamin B12 level, RPR, T4 and TSH, all of which were normal.,On 05/15/04, the patient underwent MRI scan of the brain.  I reviewed the scan in the office today.  This shows moderate cortical and central atrophy and also shows mild-to-moderate deep white matter ischemic changes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient has generally been in reasonably good physical health.  She did have a ""nervous breakdown"" in 1975 after the death of her husband.  She was hospitalized for several weeks and was treated with ECT.  This occurred while she was living in Korea.,She does not smoke or drink alcoholic beverages.  She has had no prior surgeries.  There is a past history of hypertension, but this is no longer present.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative for dementia.  Her mother died of a stroke at the age of 62.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 128/80, pulse 84, temperature 97.4 F, and weight 105 lbs (dressed).,General:  Well-developed, well-nourished Korean female in no acute distress.,Head:  Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits.,Neck:  Supple, with full range of motion.

2808," The patient is with multiple neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms including numbness, gait instability, decreased dexterity of his arms and general fatigue.  His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.", Neurology, Multiple Neurological Symptoms ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and ""walks like a duck.""  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half.,He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain.,At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression.,When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia.,When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has had diabetes for five years.  He also has had hypercholesterolemia.  He has had Crohn's disease for 25 or 30 years.  He has had a colostomy for four years.  He has arthritis, which is reportedly related to the Crohn's disease.  He has hypertension and coronary artery disease and is status post stent placement.  He has depression.  He had a kidney stone removed about 25 years ago.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , He takes Actos, Ambien, baby aspirin, Coreg, Entocort, folic acid, Flomax, iron, Lexapro 20 mg q.h.s., Lipitor, Pentasa, Plavix, Protonix, Toprol, Celebrex and Zetia.,ALLERGIES: , He states that Imuran caused him to develop tachycardia.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He previously worked with pipeline work, but has been on disability for five years.  He is unsure which symptoms led him to go on disability.  He has previously smoked about two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years, but quit about 20 years ago.  He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  He lives with his wife.  He does not really have any hobbies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , His father died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 49.  His mother died in her 70s from complications of congestive heart failure.  He has one sister who died during a cardiac surgery two years ago.  He has another sister with diabetes.  He has one daughter with hypercholesterolemia.  He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has dyspnea on exertion.  He states that he was evaluated by a pulmonologist and had a normal evaluation.  He has occasional night sweats.  His hearing is poor.  He occasionally develops bloody stools, which he attributes to his Crohn's disease.  He also was diagnosed with sleep apnea.  He does not wear his CPAP machine on a regular basis.  He has a history of anemia.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 160/86 HR 100 RR 16 Wt 211 pounds Pain 3/10,General Appearance:  He is well appearing in no acute distress.  He has somewhat of a flat affect.,Cardiovascular:  He has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  There are no carotid bruits.,Chest:  The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.,Skin:  There are no rashes or lesions.,Musculoskeletal:  He has no joint deformities or scoliosis.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:,Mental Status:  His speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia.  He is alert and oriented to name, place, and date.  Attention, concentration, and fund of knowledge are intact.  He has 3/3 object registration and 1/3 recall in 5 minutes.,Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Visual fields are full.  Optic discs are normal.  Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus.  Facial sensation is normal.  There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.  Hearing is grossly intact.  Shoulder shrug is full.,Motor:  He has normal muscle bulk and tone.  There is no atrophy.  He has few fasciculations in his calf muscles bilaterally.  Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.  There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia.,Sensory:  He has absent vibratory sensation at the left toe.  This is diminished at the right toe.  Joint position sense is intact.  There is diminished sensation to light touch and temperature at the feet to the knees bilaterally.  Pinprick is intact.  Romberg is absent.  There is no spinal sensory level.,Coordination:  This is intact by finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.  He does have a slight tremor of the head and outstretched arms.,Deep Tendon Reflexes:  They are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas, and ankles.  Plantar reflexes are flexor.  There is no ankle clonus, finger flexors, or Hoffman's signs.  He has crossed adductors bilaterally.,Gait and Stance:  He has a slightly wide-based gait.  He has some difficulty with toe walking, but he is able to walk on his heels and tandem walk.  He has difficulty with toe raises on the left.,RADIOLOGIC DATA: , MRI of the cervical spine, 09/30/08:  Chronic spondylosis at C5-C6 causing severe bilateral neuroforamining and borderline-to-mold cord compression with normal cord signal.  Spondylosis of C6-C7 causing mild bilateral neuroforamining and left paracentral disc herniation causing borderline cord compression.,Thoracic MRI spine without contrast:  Minor degenerative changes without stenosis.,I do not have the MRI of the lumbar spine available to review.,LABORATORY DATA: , 10/07/08:  Vitamin B1 210 (87-280), vitamin B6 6, ESR 6, AST 25, ALT 17, vitamin B12 905, CPK 226 (0-200), T4 0.85, TSH 3.94, magnesium 1.7, RPR nonreactive, CRP 4, Lyme antibody negative, SPEP abnormal (serum protein electrophoresis), but no paraprotein by manifestation, hemoglobin A1c 6.0, aldolase 3.9 and homocystine 9.0.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with multiple neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms including numbness, gait instability, decreased dexterity of his arms and general fatigue.  His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks.,I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I scheduled him for repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.,2.  I will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although I am confident in Dr. Z's opinion that there is no surgical indication.,3.  I gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.,4.  I believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression.  It may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but I will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist.  The patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.,5.  He does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled.  He states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well.  This should also be addressed.",
2809, Patient with stable expressive aphasia and decreased vision., Neurology, Multiple Meningiomas ,"CC:, Stable expressive aphasia and decreased vision.,HX:, This 72y/o woman was diagnosed with a left sphenoid wing meningioma on 6/3/80. She was 59 years old at the time and presented with a 6 month history of increasing irritability and left occipital-nuchal headaches. One month prior to that presentation she developed leftward head turning, and 3 days prior to presentation had an episode of severe dysphasia. A HCT (done locally) revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion of the left sphenoid wing. Skull X-rays showed deviation of the pineal to the right. She was transferred to UIHC and was noted to have a normal neurologic exam (per Neurosurgery note). Angiography demonstrated a highly vascular left temporal/sphenoid wing tumor. She under went left temporal craniotomy and ""complete resection"" of the tumor which on pathologic analysis was consistent with a meningioma.,The left sphenoid wing meningioma recurred and was excised 9/25/84. There was regrowth of this tumor seen on HCT, 1985. A 6/88 HCT revealed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma. HCT in 1989 revealed left temporal/sphenoid, left tentorial, and new left frontal lesions. On 2/14/91 she presented with increasing lethargy and difficulty concentrating. A 2/14/91, HCT revealed increased size and surrounding edema of the left frontal meningioma. The left frontal and temporal meningiomas were excised on 2/25/91. These tumors all recurred and a left parietal lesion developed. She underwent resection of the left frontal meningioma on 11/21/91 due to right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness partially resolved and though the speech improved following resection it did not return to normal. In May 1992 she experienced 3 tonic-clonic type seizures, all of which began with a Jacksonian march up the RLE then RUE before generalizing. Her Phenobarbital prophylaxis which she had been taking since her 1980 surgery was increased. On 12/7/92, she underwent a left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital craniotomy and excision of five meningiomas. Postoperatively she developed worsened right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness and aphasia improved by 3/93, but never returned to normal.","neurology, sphenoid wing meningioma, sphenoid wing, expressive aphasia, meningiomas, aphasia, sphenoidNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

The delivery was induced with Pitocin, but was otherwise uncomplicated. For the first 4 days post-partum she noted clear liquid diarrhea without blood and minor abdominal discomfort. This spontaneous resolved without medical treatment. The second week post-partum she had 4-5 days of sinusitis, purulent nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise well until 5/4/97 when stationed in a more rural area of Nigeria, she noted a dull ache in both knees (lateral to the patellae) and proximal tibia, bilaterally. The pain was not relieved by massage and seemed more bothersome when seated or supine. She had no sensory loss at the time.,On 5/6/97, she awakened to pain radiating down her knees to her anterior tibia. Over the next few hours the pain radiated circumferentially around both calves, and involved the soles of her feet and posterior BLE to her buttocks. Rising from bed became a laborious task and she required assistance to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen provided minimal analgesia. By evening the sole of one foot was numb.,She awoke the next morning, 5/9/97, with ""pins & needles"" sensation in BLE up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for analgesia and took an airplane back to the larger city she was based in.

There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR.  She is functioning well with her ileostomy.  She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.  I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less.  I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks.  I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy.  She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain.  I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain.  I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain.  The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery.  This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping.  I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery.  I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her.  Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well.  Again, her quality of life is significantly improved.  She is happy with her performance.  We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time.","soap / chart / progress notes, perineal wound, wound infection, wound, wound check, ulcerative colitis, apr, ileostomyNOTE"

1302," He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the ""bad crowd"" and come up and live with his mom.", SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes, SOAP - Substance Abuse ,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the ""bad crowd"" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 164 pounds, blood pressure 108/60, pulse 88, respirations 16, and temperature was not taken.  General:  He is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Psychiatric:  Alert and oriented times 3.  Skin:  I examined his upper extremities.  He showed me his injection sites.  I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.,ASSESSMENT: , Substance abuse.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotics or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It has been one week without any sort of drugs at all.  I do not think he needs weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression needs to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effects in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medications carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he has any problems or side effects, he was also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three weeks for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He has to call on his own.  He has no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.  His mom is going to keep an eye on him as well.  He is going to be staying there.  It sounds like he is looking for a job.","soap / chart / progress notes, addicted to drugs, substance abuse, abuse, heroin, methadone"

Her symptoms are multifactorial.,Regarding the etiology of difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, the patient has a component of psychophysiologic insomnia, based on reports of better sleep in the laboratory as compared to home.  In addition, nontrivial smoking in the home setting may be contributing significantly to sleep disruption.,Regarding her daytime sleepiness, the patient is taking a number of long-acting central nervous system acting medications to sedate her and can produce a lasting sedation throughout the daytime.  These include trazodone, Seroquel, and methadone.  Of these medications, the methadone is clearly indicative, given the history of substance abuse.  It would be desirable to reduce or discontinue trazodone and then perhaps consider doing the same with Seroquel.  I brought this possibility up with the patient, and I asked her to discuss this further with her psychiatrist.,Finally, to help mitigate sleep disruption at night, I have provided her with tips for sleep hygiene.  These include bedtime rituals, stimulus control therapy, and sleep restriction as well as avoidance of nicotine in the evening hours.",

There was a suggestion of a bilateral lower lobe pneumonitis or pneumonia.,She has been on Zosyn for the infection.,Throughout her hospitalization, we have been trying to adjust her pain medications.  She states that the methadone did not work for her.  She was ""immune"" to oxycodone.  She had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that.  There was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness.  She also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder.,Apparently, her husband was in this afternoon.  He had a box of her pain medications.  It is unclear whether she took a bunch of these or precisely what happened.  I was contacted that she was less responsive.  She periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications, which she has been requesting repeatedly, though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain.  The nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point.  There was a concern that she had taken some medications from home.  She was given Narcan and appeared to come around some.  Breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi, which certainly changed from this a.m.  Additional Narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse a possible benzodiazepine toxicity.  With O2 via mask, oxygenation was stable at 90% to 95% after initial hypoxia was noted.  A chest x-ray was obtained at this time.  An ECG was obtained, which shows a sinus tachycardia, noted to have ischemic abnormalities.,In light of the acute decompensation, she was then transferred to the ICU.  We will continue the IV Zosyn.  Respiratory protocol with respiratory management.  Continue alprazolam p.r.n., but avoid if she appears sedated.  We will attempt to avoid additional pain medications, but we will continue with the Dilaudid for time being.  I suspect she will need something to control her bipolar disorder.,Pulmonary Medicine Associates have been contacted to consult in light of the ICU admission.  At this juncture, she does not appear to need an intubation.  Pending chest x-ray, she may require additional IV furosemide.","soap / chart / progress notes, shortness of breath, pulmonary medicine, bipolar disorder, icuNOTE"

I had last seen her on 06/21/07.,At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy.  She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07.  At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI.  I did not have any recent images.  I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.,She states that her symptoms are unchanged.  She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y.,She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist.  She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note.  No significant right upper extremity symptoms.  No bowel, bladder dysfunction.  No difficulty with ambulation.,FINDINGS: , On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities.

It is relatively limited study due to artifact.  He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change.  There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.,I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery.  With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with.  I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections.  The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.,I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine.,I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks.","soap / chart / progress notes, upper extremity, radiculopathy, rotator cuff repair, cervical spinal stenosis, rotator cuff tear, physical examination, cuff, impingement, stenosis, extremity, surgery, tear, shoulder, rotator, cervical,"

Switch him to the Ritalin LA, which I think has better release of the medicine early in the morning or to increase his Adderall dose.  As far as the afternoon, if she really wanted him to be on the medication, we will do a small dose of the Adderall, which she would prefer.  So I have decided at this point to increase him to the Adderall XR 15 mg in the morning and then Adderall 5 mg in the afternoon.  Mother is to watch his diet.  We would like to recheck his weight if he is doing very well, in two months.  But if there are any problems, especially in the morning then we would do the Ritalin LA.  Mother understands and will call if there are problems.

His urinary function had been stable until 2 days ago.  Over the past couple of days he has been waking every 1 to 1-1/2 hours and has had associated abdominal cramping, as well as a bit of sore throat (his wife has had a cold for about 2 weeks).  His libido remains intact (but he has not been sexually functional), but his erections have been dysfunctional.  The bowel function is stable with occasional irritative hemorrhoidal symptoms.

1326," Patient seen initially with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating.", SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes, Progress Note - Liver Cirrhosis ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating.  The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.  Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody.  Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion.  He spent 3 days in the hospital.  He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient.  From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection.  At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area.,HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOM intact.  Oropharynx is clear of lesions.,NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Not tender, not distended.  Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin.  No hepatomegaly.  Bowel sounds present.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.  No asterixis.  No costovertebral tenderness.,PSYCHE:  The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative.,LABORATORY DATA: , We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63.  His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53.  We do not have any other results back.  No hepatitis panels.  No alpha-fetoprotein level.  The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.,1.  Epigastric pain.  The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time.  In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.  His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.  He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.,2.  End-stage liver disease.  Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis.  We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.  We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.  Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result.  It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.,We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.  We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver.  We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also.  We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.  PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.  Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.  On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.  We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.  I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.  We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.  The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.  We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.,At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily.  The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.  I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.  As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.  The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.  He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.  The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.  The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.,Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.,We also discussed nutrition issues.  The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.  He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.  He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.  His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.","soap / chart / progress notes, abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, liver disease, epigastric pain, liver cirrhosis, liver, abdominal, cirrhosis, epigastric, hepatitis,"

Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome.,Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side.  She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.  She will continue to see Dr. Berry and continue her therapy with Mary Hotchkinson in Victoria.","soap / chart / progress notes, progress note, management, muscle"

She returns today to review results of an inpatient study performed approximately two weeks ago.,In the meantime, the patient reports she continues on substantial doses of opiate medication to control leg pain from mononeuritis multiplex.,She also takes Lasix for lower extremity edema.,The patient reports that she generally initiates sleep on CPAP, but rips her mask off, tosses and turns throughout the night and has ""terrible quality sleep."",MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are as previously noted.  Changes include reduction in prednisone from 9 to 6 mg by mouth every morning.  She continues to take Ativan 1 mg every six hours as needed.  She takes imipramine 425 mg at bedtime.,Her MS Contin dose is 150 mg every 8 to 12 hours and an immediate release morphine preparation, 45 to 75 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed.,FINDINGS: , Vital signs:  Blood pressure 153/81, pulse 90, respiratory rate 20, weight 311.8 pounds (up 10 pounds from earlier this month), height 5 feet 6 inches, temperature 98.4 degrees, SaO2 is 88% on room air at rest.  Chest is clear.  Extremities show lower extremity pretibial edema with erythema.,LABORATORIES: , An arterial blood gas on room air showed a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 52, and PO2 of 57.,CPAP compliance monitoring over the past two to three weeks showed average use of 3 hours 26 minutes on nights used.  She used it for greater than 4 hours per night on 67% of night surveyed.  Her estimated apnea/hypopnea index was 3 per hour.  Her average leak flow was 67 liters per minute.,The patient's overnight sleep study was performed as an inpatient sleep study during a routine hospitalization for intravenous gamma globulin therapy.  She slept for a total sleep time of 257 minutes out of 272 minutes in bed (sleep efficiency approximately 90%).  Sleep stage distribution was relatively normal with 2% stage I, 72% stage II, 24% stage III, IV, and 2% stage REM sleep.,There were no periodic limb movements during sleep.,There was evidence of a severe predominantly central sleep apnea during non-REM sleep at 173 episodes per hour and during REM sleep at 77 episodes per hour.  Oxyhemoglobin saturations during non-REM sleep fluctuated from the baseline of 92% to an average low of 82%.  During REM sleep, the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation was 87% , decreased to 81% with sleep-disordered breathing episodes.,Of note, the sleep study was performed on CPAP at 10.5 cm of H2O with oxygen at 8 liters per minute.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  The patient has evidence of a well-compensated respiratory acidosis, which is probably primarily related to severe obesity.  In addition, there may be contribution from large doses of opiates and standing doses of gabapentin.,2.  Severe central sleep apnea, on CPAP at 10 cmH2O and supplemental oxygen at 8 liters per minute.  The breathing pattern is that of cluster or Biot's breathing throughout sleep.  The primary etiology is probably opiate use, with contribution with further exacerbation by severe obesity which acts to lower the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation, and worsen desaturations during apneic episodes.,3.  Mononeuritis multiplex with pain requiring significant substantial doses of analgesia.,4.  Hypoxemia primarily due to obesity, hypoventilation, and presumably basilar atelectasis and a combination of V/Q mismatch and shunt on that basis.,PLANS: , My overall impression is that we should treat this patient's sleep disruption with measures to decrease central sleep apnea during sleep.  These will include, (1).  Decrease in evening doses of MS Contin, (2).  Modest weight loss of approximately 10 to 20 pounds, and (3).  Instituting Automated Servo Ventilation via nasal mask.  With regard to latter, the patient will be returning for a trial of ASV to examine its effect on sleep-disordered breathing patterns.,In addition, the patient will benefit from modest diuresis, with improvement of oxygenation, as well as nocturnal desaturation and oxygen requirements.  I have encouraged the patient to increase her dose of Lasix from 100 to 120 mg by mouth every morning as previously prescribed.  I have also asked her to add Lasix in additional late afternoon to evening dose of Lasix at 40 mg by mouth at that time.  She was instructed to take between one and two K-Tab with her evening dose of Lasix (10 to 20 mEq).,In addition, we will obtain a complete set of pulmonary function studies to evaluate this patient for underlying causes of parenchymal lung disease that may interfere with oxygenation.  Further workup for hypoxemia may include high-resolution CT scanning if evidence for significant pulmonary restriction and/or reductions in diffusion capacity is evident on pulmonary function testing.","soap / chart / progress notes, polyarteritis nodosa, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary function, obesity hypoventilation, mononeuritis multiplex, sleep apnea, sleep study, rem sleep, ativan, sleep, hypoventilation, obesity, "

Please see dictated ICU transfer note yesterday detailing the need for emergent transfer transfusion and EGD in this patient.  Over the last 24 hours, the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value.  He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X.  I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding.  Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future.  The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU.  He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8.

Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis.  We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding.  If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This does appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.,3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He has refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.,4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.  Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes.","soap / chart / progress notes, anemia, gi bleeding, hemoglobin, ulcerative, esophagitis, obstructive pulmonary disease, icu followup, infection, obstructive, pulmonary, egd, melena, bleeding"

1356, Patient is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy., SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes, Lung Biopsy Discussion ,"CHART NOTE:,  She is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy that she has actually scheduled for tomorrow.  Dr. XYZ had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath.  Then she had the pulmonary function test and CT scan and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis, but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see Dr. XYZ Estep.  He had concurred with Dr. XYZ that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both Dr. XYZ and I were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy.  She was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath.  She is very concerned about the findings on her CAT scan and pulmonary function test.  She seemed alarmed to report that Dr. XYZ had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60% of what should be normal.  However, I told her that two years ago Dr. XYZ did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function.  And that really her pulmonary function test, at least compared from two years ago, had not really changed over this period of time.  After discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy, the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years, the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath, which is deconditioning and obesity, she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy.  In fact when I called Dr. XYZ to talk to him about cancelling the procedure, he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed.  I also explained to patient that I did not think Dr. XYZ was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those.  And also I spoke with Dr. XYZ who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate, that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities.,I had a 30-minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it.  I also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her CAT scan, x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.  And if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem, she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy.  But she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her.  She understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful.,We are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing.  We will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with a pulmonologist at that time.  I told her I would try to talk to her sister sometime in the next day or two.","soap / chart / progress notes, discuss, interstitial pneumonitis, lung biopsy, lung capacity, pulmonary function test, shortness of breath, pulmonary function studies, pulmonary function, function, biopsy, lung, interstitial, pulmonaryNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw.  We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw.  Postoperatively, her pain had improved.,I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well.  She had symptoms of what she thought was ""restless leg syndrome"" at that time.  She has been put on ReQuip for this.,She returned.  I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved.  I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative.  She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg.  Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation.,She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively.  She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively.  The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively.  The right leg pain is improved.  The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side.,She denies any significant low back pain.  No right lower extremity symptoms.,No infectious symptoms whatsoever.  No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath.  No drainage from the wound.  No difficulties with the incision.,FINDINGS:  ,On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x 3.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Respirations are normal and nonlabored.  Afebrile to touch.,Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5.  Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5.  This has all been changed compared to preoperatively.  Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5.  Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot.  Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally.,The incision is well healed.  There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever.  No drainage.,Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws.,Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5.  There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07.  The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms.,I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms.  However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection.  I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time.,I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection.,My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization.  I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time.  She is happy with this.,I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible.  She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested.  I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management.,I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve.  She knows that if she has any difficulties, she may follow up with me sooner.","soap / chart / progress notes, spinal fusion, restless leg syndrome, posterior spinal fusion, pedicle screw, lumbar spine, bilateral foraminotomies, fluid collection, foraminotomy, instrumentation, laminectomy, screw, spine, "

Live male infant with Apgars of 9 and 9.,2.  Placenta delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient and baby remain in the LDR in stable condition.,SUMMARY: , This is a 36-year-old G1 woman who was pregnant since 40 weeks 6 days when she was admitted for induction of labor for post dates with favorable cervix.  When she was admitted, her cervix was 2.5 cm dilated with 80% effacement.  The baby had a -2 station.  She had no regular contractions.  Fetal heart tones were 120s and reactive.  She was started on Pitocin for labor induction and labored quite rapidly.  She had spontaneous rupture of membranes with a clear fluid.  She had planned on an epidural; however, she had sudden rapid cervical change and was unable to get the epidural.  With the rapid cervical change and descent of fetal head, there were some variable decelerations.  The baby was at a +1 station when the patient began pushing.  I had her push to get the baby to a +2 station.  During pushing, the fetal heart tones were in the 80s and did not recover in between contractions.  Because of this, I recommended a vacuum delivery for the baby.  The patient agreed.,The baby's head was confirmed to be in the right occiput anterior presentation.  The perineum was injected with 1% lidocaine.  The bladder was drained.  The vacuum was placed and the correct placement in front of the posterior fontanelle was confirmed digitally.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was inflated and a gentle downward pressure was used to assist with brining the baby's head to a +3 station.  The contraction ended.  The vacuum was released and the fetal heart tones remained in the, at this time, 90s to 100s.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was reapplied and the baby's head was delivered to a +4 station.  A modified Ritgen maneuver was used to stabilize the fetal head.  The vacuum was deflated and removed.  The baby's head then delivered atraumatically.  There was no nuchal cord.  The baby's anterior shoulder delivered after a less than 30 second delay.  No additional maneuvers were required to deliver the anterior shoulder.  The posterior shoulder and remainder of the body delivered easily.  The baby's mouth and nose were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped x2 and cut.  The infant was handed to the respiratory therapist.,Pitocin was added to the patient's IV fluids.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, was intact and had a three-vessel cord.  A vaginal inspection revealed a third-degree midline laceration as well as a right vaginal side wall laceration.  The right side wall laceration was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion with local anesthesia.  The third-degree laceration was also repaired with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Local anesthesia was used.  The capsule was visible, but did not appear to be injured at all.  It was reinforced with three separate interrupted sutures and then the remainder of the incision was closed with #3-0 Vicryl in the typical fashion.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  She remains in the LDR with the baby.  The baby is vigorous, crying and moving all extremities.  He will go to the new born nursery when ready.  The total time for repair of the laceration was 25 minutes.","obstetrics / gynecology, intrauterine pregnancy, non-reassuring fetal heart tones, vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery, vaginal side wall laceration, fetal heart tones, vaginal delivery, vacuum assisted, laceration, intrauterine, tones, contractions, "

Uterine fibroids.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual manner for a laparoscopic procedure.  A speculum was placed into the vagina.  A single tooth tenaculum was utilized to grasp the anterior lip of the uterine cervix.  The uterus was sounded to 10.5 cm.  A #10 RUMI cannula was utilized and attached for uterine manipulation.  The single-tooth tenaculum and speculum were removed from the vagina.  At this time, the infraumbilical area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and infraumbilical vertical skin incision was made through which a Veress needle was inserted into the abdominal cavity.  Aspiration was negative; therefore the abdomen was insufflated with carbon dioxide.  After adequate insufflation, Veress needle was removed and an 11-mm separator trocar was introduced through the infraumbilical incision into the abdominal cavity.  Through the trocar sheath, the laparoscope was inserted and adequate visualization of the pelvic structures was noted.  At this time, the suprapubic area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine.  A 5-mm skin incision was made and a 5-mm trocar was introduced into the abdominal cavity for instrumentation.  Evaluation of the pelvis revealed the uterus to be slightly enlarged and irregular.  The fallopian tubes have been previously interrupted surgically.  The ovaries appeared normal bilaterally.  The cul-de-sac was clean without evidence of endometriosis, scarring or adhesions.  The ureters were noted to be deep in the pelvis.  At this time, the right cornu was grasped and the right fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected without difficulty.  The remainder of the uterine vessels and anterior and posterior leaves of the broad ligament, as well as the cardinal ligament was coagulated and transected in a serial fashion down to level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  A similar procedure was carried out on the left with the left uterine cornu identified.  The left fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The remainder of the cardinal ligament, uterine vessels, anterior, and posterior sheaths of the broad ligament were coagulated and transected in a serial manner to the level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was then dissected to the midline bilaterally, establishing a bladder flap with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  At this time, attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The laparoscope was removed and attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The RUMI cannula was removed and the anterior and posterior leafs of the cervix were grasped with Lahey tenaculum.  A circumferential injection with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was made at the cervicovaginal portio.  A circumferential incision was then made at the cervicovaginal portio.  The anterior and posterior colpotomies were accomplished with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection without difficulty.  The right uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The left uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The parametrial tissue was then clamped bilaterally, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture bilaterally.  The uterus was then removed and passed off the operative field.  Laparotomy pack was placed into the pelvis.  The pedicles were evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted; therefore, the laparotomy pack was removed.  The uterosacral ligaments were suture fixated into the vaginal cuff angles with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The vaginal cuff was then closed in a running fashion with #0 Vicryl suture.  Hemostasis was noted throughout.  At this time, the laparoscope was reinserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was reinsufflated.  Evaluation revealed no further bleeding.  Irrigation with sterile water was performed and again no bleeding was noted.  The suprapubic trocar sheath was then removed under laparoscopic visualization.  The laparoscope was removed.  The carbon dioxide was allowed to escape from the abdomen and the infraumbilical trocar sheath was then removed.  The skin incisions were closed with #4-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  Neosporin and Band-Aid were applied for dressing and the patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Estimated blood loss was approximately 100 mL.  There were no complications.  The instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct.","obstetrics / gynecology, abnormal uterine bleeding, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, uterine fibroids, bipolar electrocautery, vaginal hysterectomy, vicryl sutures, tooth, uterine, uterosacral, laparoscope, electrocautery, hysterectomy, laparoscopic, coagulated, vaginal, ligament, transected"

The patient was estimated to be approximately 10-1/2 weeks so long in her pregnancy.  She began to have heavy vaginal bleeding and intense lower pelvic cramping.  She was seen in the emergency room where she was found to be hemodynamically stable.  On pelvic exam, her cervix was noted to be 1 to 2 cm dilated and approximately 90% effaced.  There were bulging membranes protruding through the dilated cervix.  These symptoms were consistent with the patient's prior experience of spontaneous miscarriages.  These findings were reviewed with her and options for treatment discussed.  She elected to proceed with an exam under anesthesia with uterine suction curettage.  The risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her and knowing these, she gave informed consent.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where she was placed in the seated position.  A spinal anesthetic was successfully administered.  She was then moved to a dorsal lithotomy position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.  After adequate spinal level was confirmed, a bimanual exam was again performed.  This revealed the uterus to be anteverted to axial and approximately 10 to 11 weeks in size.  The previously noted cervical exam was confirmed.  The weighted vaginal speculum was then inserted and the vaginal vault flooded with povidone solution.  This solution was then removed approximately 10 minutes later with dry sterile gauze sponge.  The anterior cervical lip was then attached with a ring clamp.  The tissue and membranes protruding through the os were then gently grasped with a ring clamp and traction applied.  The tissue dislodged revealing fluid mixed with blood as well as an apparent 10-week fetus.  The placental tissue was then gently tractioned out as well.  A size 9 curved suction curette was then gently inserted through the dilated os and into the endometrial cavity.  With the vacuum tubing applied in rotary motion, a moderate amount of tissue consistent with products of conception was evacuated.  The sharp curette was then utilized to probe the endometrial surface.  A small amount of additional tissue was then felt in the posterior uterine wall.  This was curetted free.  A second pass was then made with a vacuum curette.  Again, the endometrial cavity was probed with a sharp curette and no significant additional tissue was encountered.  A final pass was then made with a suction curette.,The ring clamp was then removed from the anterior cervical lip.  There was only a small amount of bleeding following the curettage.  The weighted speculum was then removed as well.  The bimanual exam was repeated and good involution was noted.  The patient was taken down from the dorsal lithotomy position.  She was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The sponge and instrument count was performed and found to be correct.  The specimen of products of conception and 10-week fetus were submitted to Pathology for further evaluation.  The estimated blood loss for the procedure is less than 10 mL.","obstetrics / gynecology, spontaneous, incomplete abortion, uterine suction curettage, fetus, anterior cervical lip, spontaneous incomplete abortion, bimanual exam, ring clamp, suction curettage, uterine, curettage, suction"

The appendix was normal appearing.  The bowel and omentum were normal appearing.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  Peritoneal surfaces and vesicouterine peritoneum as well as appendix and cul-de-sac were all free of any evidence of endometriosis.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the Operating Room where first a spinal anesthesia with Astramorph was obtained without any difficulty.  She then underwent a general anesthesia with endotracheal tube also without any difficulty.  She was then examined under anesthesia with noted findings as above.  The patient was then placed in dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion..  A vertical skin incision was made 1 cm below the umbilicus extending down to 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  This was made with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia with the second knife.  Fascia was excised in the midline and extended superiorly and inferiorly with the Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum identified and entered bluntly.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with external visualization of the bladder.  The uterus was markedly evident upon entering the peritoneal cavity.  The uterus was then exteriorized and noted to have the findings as above.  At this point, approximately 10 cc of vasopressin 20 units and 30 cc was injected into the uterine fundus and multiple fibroids were removed by using the incision with the Bovie and then using a blunt and the sharp dissection and grasping with Lahey clamps.  Once the debulking of the uterus was felt appropriate to proceed with the hysterectomy, the uterus was then reapproximated with a few #0 Vicryl sutures in a figure-of-eight fashion.  The round ligaments were identified bilaterally and clamped with the hemostats and transacted with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The round ligaments were then bilaterally tied with the #0 tie and noted to be hemostatic.  The uterovarian vessels bilaterally were then isolated through a vascular window created from taking down the round ligaments.  The uterovarian vessels bilaterally were #0 tied and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and transacted and suture tied with a Heaney hand stitch fashion, and both uterine and ovarian vessels were noted to be hemostatic.  At this time, the attention was then turned to the vesicouterine peritoneum, which was tented up with Allis clamps and the bladder flap was then created sharply with Russian pickups and the Metzenbaum scissors.  Then the bladder was bluntly dissected off the underlying cervix with a moist Ray-Tec sponge down to the level of the cervix.,At this point, the uterus was pulled on traction and the uterosacral ligaments were easily visualized.  Using #2-0 PDS suture, the suture was placed through both uterosacral ligaments distally with a backhand stitch fashion throwing the sutures from lateral to medial.  These sutures were then tagged and saved for later.  The uterine vessels were then identified bilaterally and skeletonized, then clamped with straight Ochsner clamps balancing off the cervix, and the uterine vessels were then transacted and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl and noted to be hemostatic.  In a similar fashion, the broad ligament down to the level of the cardinal ligaments was clamped with curved Ochsner and transacted and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  At this point, the Lahey clamp was placed on the cervix and the cervix was tented up.  The pubocervical vesical fascia was transacted with long knife.  Then while protecting posteriorly, using the double-pointed scissors, the vagina was entered with double-pointed scissors at the level of the cervix and was grasped with a straight Ochsner clamp.  The uterus and cervix were then amputated using the Jorgenson scissors and the cuff was outlined with Ochsner clamps.  The cuff was then copiously painted with Betadine soaked sponge.  The Betadine-soaked sponge was placed in the patient's vagina.  Then the cuff was then closed with a #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion to make sure to bring the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the vaginal cuff.  This was accomplished with one #0 Vicryl running stitch and then an Allis clamp was placed in the midsection portion of the cuff and tented up and a #0 Vicryl figure-of-eight was placed in the midsection portion of the cuff.  At this time, the uterosacral ligaments previously tagged needle was brought through the cardinal ligament and the uterosacral ligament on the ipsilateral side.  The needle was cut off and these were then tagged with the hemostats.  The cuff was then closed by taking the running suture and bringing back through the posterior peritoneum, grabbing part of the uterosacral and midsection portion of the posterior peritoneum of the uterosacral and then tying the cuff down to bunch and cuff together.  The suture in the midportion of the cuff was then used to tie down the round ligaments bilaterally to the cuff.  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  All areas were noted to be hemostatic.  Then the previously tagged uterosacral sutures were then tied bringing the vaginal cuff angles down to the uterosacral ligaments.  The abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  All areas were noted to be hemostatic.  The sigmoid colon was replaced back into the hollow of the sacrum.  Then the omentum was pulled over the bowel.  After the myomectomy was performed, the GYN Balfour was placed into the patient's abdomen and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  The GYN Balfour was then removed.  Packing sponges were removed and the fascia was then closed in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion with #0 Vicryl.,Skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The sponge from the patient's vagina was removed and the vagina was noted to be hemostatic.  The patient would be followed throughout her hospital stay.",

On ultrasound, the uterus measured 14 cm x 6.5 cm x 7.8 cm.  She had received two dosage of Lupron to help shrink the fibroid.  Her most recent Pap smear was normal.,FINDINGS: , On a manual exam, the uterus is enlarged approximately 14 to 16 weeks size with multiple fibroids palpated.  On laparotomy, the uterus did have multiple pedunculated fibroids, the largest being approximately 7 cm.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.,There was evidence of endometriosis on the posterior wall of the uterus as well as the bilateral infundibulopelvic ligament.  There was some adhesions of the bowel to the left ovary and infundibulopelvic ligament and as well as to the right infundibulopelvic ligament.,PROCEDURE:,  After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthetic was first administered and then general anesthetic.  The patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made and carried to the underlying Mayo fashion using the second knife.  The fascia was incised in midline and the incision extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying rectus muscle both bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision, which in a similar fashion was grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up and dissected off the underlying rectus muscles.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was identified, grasped with hemostat, and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus was then brought up out of the incision.  The bowel adhesions were carefully taken down using Metzenbaum scissors.  Good hemostasis was noted at this point.  The self-retaining retractor was then placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was gently packed with moist laparotomy sponges and held in place with the blade on the GYN extension.  The uterus was then grasped with a Lahey clamp and brought up out of the incision.  The left round ligament was identified and grasped with Allis clamp and tented up.  A hemostat was passed in the avascular area beneath the round ligament.  A suture #0 Vicryl was used to suture ligate the round ligament.  Two hemostats were placed across the round ligament proximal to the previously placed suture and the Mayo scissors were used to transect the round ligament.  An avascular area of the broad ligament was then identified and entered bluntly.  The suture of #0 Vicryl was then used to suture ligate the left uterovarian ligament.  Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the uterovarian ligament proximal to the previous suture.  The ligament was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Attention was then turned to the right round ligament, which in a similar fashion was tented up with an Allis clamp.  An avascular area was entered beneath the round ligament using a hemostat and the round ligament was suture ligated and transected.  An avascular area of the broad ligament was then entered bluntly and the right uterovarian ligament was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.,Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the ligament proximal to previous suture.  This was then transected and suture ligated again with #0 Vicryl.  The left uterine peritoneum was then identified and grasped with Allis clamps.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then transected and then entered using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended across the anterior portion of the uterus and the bladder flap was taken down.  It was sharply advanced with Metzenbaum scissors and then bluntly using a moist Ray-Tec.  The Ray-Tec was left in place at this point to ensure that the bladder was below the level of the cervix.  The bilateral uterine arteries then were skeletonized with Metzenbaum scissors and clamped bilaterally using straight Ochsner's.  Each were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  A curved Ochsner was then placed on either side of the cervix.  The tissue was transected using a long knife and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Incidentally, prior to taking down the round ligaments, a pedunculated fibroid and the right fundal portion of the uterus was injected with Vasopressin and removed using a Bovie.  The cervix was then grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The cervicovaginal fascia was then taken down first using the long-handed knife and then a back handle of the knife to bring the fascia down below the level of the cervix.  A double-pointed scissors were used to enter the vaginal vault below the level of the cervix.  A straight Ochsner was placed on the vaginal vault.  The Jorgenson scissors were used to amputate the cervix and the uterus off of the underlying vaginal tissue.  The vaginal cuff was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion and the pelvis was copiously irrigated.  There was a small area of bleeding noted on the underside of the bladder.  The bladder was tented up using an Allis clamp and a figure-of-eight suture of #3-0 Vicryl was placed with excellent hemostasis noted at this point.  The uterosacral ligaments were then incorporated into the vaginal cuff and the cuff was synched down.  A figure-of-eight suture of #0 Vicryl was placed in the midline of the vaginal cuff in attempt to incorporate the bilateral round ligament.  The round ligament was too short.  It would be a maximal amount of stretch to incorporate, therefore, only the left round ligament was incorporated into the vaginal cuff.  The bilateral adnexal areas were then re-peritonealized with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The bladder flap was reapproximated to the vaginal cuff using one interrupted suture.  The pelvis was again irrigated at this point with excellent hemostasis noted.  Approximately 200 cc of saline with methylene blue was placed into the Foley to inflate the bladder.  There was no spillage of blue fluid into the abdomen.  The fluid again was allowed to drain.  All sponges were then removed and the bowel was allowed to return to its anatomical position.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated also with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin was then closed with staples.,A previously placed Betadine soaked Ray-Tec was removed from the patient's vagina and sponge stick was used to assess any bleeding in the vaginal vault.  There was no appreciable bleeding.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

At the time of the surgery, all the tissue was quite thick and difficult to cut as well around the bladder flap and the uterus itself.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position, at which time general form of anesthesia was administered by the anesthesia department.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  Approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis, a first knife was used to make a low transverse incision.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher.  Both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was then completed consistent with Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the midline and extended in a vertical fashion.  Perineum was entered at the high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  An O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was put in place on either side.  A bladder blade was put in place as well.  Uterus was grasped with a double-tooth tenaculum and large and small colon were packed away cephalically and held in place with free wet lap packs and a superior blade.  The bladder flap was released with Metzenbaum scissors and then dissected away caudally.  EndoGIA were placed down both sides of the uterus in two bites on each side with the staples reinforced with a medium Endoclip.  Two Heaney were placed on either side of the uterus at the level of cardinal ligaments.  These were sharply incised and both pedicles were tied off with 1 Vicryl suture.  Two _____ were placed from either side of the uterus at the level just inferior to the cervix across the superior part of the vaginal vault.  A long sharp knife was used to transect the uterus at the level of Merz forceps and the uterus and cervix were removed intact.  From there, the corners of the vaginal cuff were reinforced with figure-of-eight stitches.  Betadine soaked sponge was placed in the vaginal vault and a continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the edges with a second layer used to reinforce the first.  Bladder flap was created with the use of 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam was placed underneath.

The uterus was found to be normal in size with evidence of endometriosis on the uterus.  The right ovary and fallopian tube were absent.  The left fallopian tube and ovary appeared normal with evidence of a small functional cyst.  There was evidence of left adnexal adhesion to the pelvic side wall which was filmy, unable to be bluntly dissected.  There were multiple interloop bowel adhesions that were filmy in nature noted.,The appendix was absent.  There did appear to be old suture in a portion of the bowel most likely from a prior procedure.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 45-year-old African-American gravida7, para3-0-0-3, who is here for definitive treatment of chronic pelvic pain with a history of endometriosis.  She did have a laparoscopic ablation of endometriosis on a laparoscopy and also has a history of right salpingo-oophorectomy.  She has tried Lupron and did stop secondary to the side effects.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the Operating Suite and placed under general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and placed in the dorsal supine position.  An indwelling Foley catheter was placed.  With the skin knife, an incision was made removing the old cicatrix.  A Bovie was used to carry the tissue through to the underlying layer of the fascia which was incised in the midline and extended with the Bovie.  The rectus muscle was then sharply and bluntly dissected off the superior aspect of the rectus fascia in the superior as well as the inferior aspect using the Bovie.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline using a hemostat and the peritoneum was entered bluntly.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with Metzenbaum scissors with careful visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the intraabdominal cavity was manually explored and the above findings were noted.  A Lahey clamp was then placed on the fundus of the uterus and the uterus was brought to the surgical field.  The bowel was then packed with moist laparotomy sponges.  Prior to this, the filmy adhesions leftover were taken down.  At this point, the left round ligament was identified, grasped with two hemostats, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  At this point, the broad ligament was dissected down and the lost portion of the bladder flap was created.  The posterior aspect of the peritoneum was also dissected.  At this point, the infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated and three tie of #0 Vicryl was used to isolate the pedicle.  Two hemostats were then placed across the pedicle and this was transected with the scalpel.  This was then suture ligated in Heaney fashion.  The right round ligament was then identified and in the similar fashion, two hemostats were placed across the round ligament and using the Mayo scissors the round ligament was transected and dissected down the broad ligament to create the bladder flap anteriorly as well as dissect the posterior peritoneum and isolate the round ligament.  This was then ligated with three tie of #0 Vicryl.  Also incorporated in this was the remnant from the previous right salpingo-oophorectomy.  At this point, the bladder flap was further created with sharp dissection as well as the moist Ray-Tech to push the bladder down off the anterior portion of the cervix.,The left uterine artery was then skeletonized and a straight Heaney was placed.  In a similar fashion, the contralateral uterine artery was skeletonized and straight Heaney clamp was placed.  These ligaments bilaterally were transected and suture ligated in a left Heaney stitch.  At this point, curved Masterson was used to incorporate the cardinal ligament complex, thus was transected and suture ligated.  Straight Masterson was then used to incorporate the uterosacrals bilaterally and this was also transected and suture ligated.  Prior to ligating the uterine arteries, the uterosacral arteries were tagged bilaterally with #0 Vicryl.  At this point, the roticulator was placed across the vaginal cuff and snug underneath the entire cervix.  The roticulator was then clamped and removed and the staple line was in place.  This was found to be hemostatic.  A suture was then placed through each cuff angle bilaterally and cardinal ligament complex was found to be fixed to each apex bilaterally.  At this point, McCall culdoplasty was performed with an #0 Vicryl incorporating each uterosacral as well as the posterior peritoneum.  There did appear to be good support on palpation.  Prior to this, the specimen was handed off and sent to pathology.  At this point, there did appear to be small amount of oozing at the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis was obtained using a #0 Vicryl in two single stitches.  Good hemostasis was then obtained on the cuff as well as the pedicles.  Copious irrigation was performed at this point with lactate Ringers.  The round ligaments were then incorporated into the cuff bilaterally.  Again, copious amount of irrigation was performed and good hemostasis was obtained.  At this point, the peritoneum was reapproximated in a single interrupted stitch on the left and right lateral aspects to cover each pedicle bilaterally.  At this point, the bowel packing as well as moist Ray-Tech was removed and while re-approximating the bowel it was noted that there were multiple interloop bowel adhesions which were taken down using the Metzenbaum scissors with good visualization of the underlying bowel.  Good hemostasis was obtained of these sites as well.  The sigmoid colon was then returned to its anatomic position and the omentum as well.  The rectus muscle was then reapproximated with two interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion from lateral to medial meeting in the midline.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with #3-0 plain in a running suture.  The skin was then re-approximated with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure.  This was dressed with an Op-Site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle were correct x2.  After the procedure, the patient was extubated and brought out of general anesthesia.  She will go to the floor where she will be followed postoperatively in the hospital.","obstetrics / gynecology, chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis, intrauterine device, exploratory, abdominal hysterectomy, tah, total abdominal hysterectomy, lysis of interloop bowel adhesions, salpingo oophorectomy, bowel, ligament, adhesions, interloop, hemostasis, uterus, salpingo, oophorectomy, "

There were no adnexal masses appreciated.  Intraabdominal findings revealed a small uterus approximately 2 cm in size.  The ovaries were atrophic consistent with menopause.  The liver margins and stomach were palpated and found to be normal.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and administered a spinal anesthesia for postoperative pain control.  She was then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and administered general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and an indwelling Foley catheter was placed in her bladder.  At this point, the patient was evaluated for a possible vaginal hysterectomy.  She was nulliparous and the pelvis was narrow.  After the anesthesia was administered, the patient was repeatedly stooling and therefore because of these two reasons, the decision was made to do an abdominal hysterectomy.  After the patient was prepped and draped, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  The second scalpel was used to dissect out to the underlying layer of fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was grasped with Ochsners, tented up and underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  In a similar fashion, the inferior portion of the rectus fascia was tented up, dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated bluntly in the midline and the peritoneum was identified and entered with the Metzenbaum.  The peritoneal incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the above findings were noted and the GYN Balfour retractor was placed.  Moist laparotomy sponges were used to pack the bowel out of the operative field.  The bladder blade and the extension for the retractor were then placed.  An Allis was used on the uterus for retraction.  The round ligaments were then identified, clamped with two hemostats and transected and then suture ligated.  The anterior portion of the broad ligament was dissected along vesicouterine resection.  The bladder was then dissected off the anterior cervix and vagina without difficulty.  The infundibulopelvic ligaments on both sides were then doubly clamped using hemostats, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The uterine vessels on both sides were skeletonized and clamped with two hemostats and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was assured.  The cardinal ligaments on both sides were clamped using a curved hemostat, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  Two hemostats were then placed just under the cervix meeting in the midline.  The uterus and cervix were then _______ off using a scalpel.  This was handed and sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Using #0 Vicryl suture, the right vaginal cuff angle was closed and affixed to the ipsilateral cardinal ligament.  A baseball stitch was then used to close the cuff to the midline.  The same was done to the left vaginal cuff angle, which was affixed to the ipsilateral and cardinal ligaments.  The baseball stitch was used to close the cuff to the midline.  The hemostats were removed and the cuff was closed and good hemostasis was noted.  The uterosacral ligaments were also transfixed to the cuff and brought out for good support by using a #0 Vicryl suture through each uterosacral ligament and incorporating this into the vaginal cuff.  The pelvis was then copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  Good support and hemostasis was noted.  The bowel packing was then removed and the GYN Balfour retractor was moved.  The peritoneum was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was then closed using #0 Vicryl in a running fashion, marking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure and an Op-Site was placed over this.  The patient was then brought out of general anesthesia and extubated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She will follow up postoperatively as an inpatient.","obstetrics / gynecology, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, vaginal vault prolapse, uterosacral ligament vault suspension, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingooophorectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, uterosacral ligament, recurrent dysplasia, uterine procidentia, suture ligated, abdominal, intraepithelial, tah, salpingooophorectomy, hysterectomy, ligament, hemostats, vaginal, "

Operative findings demonstrated the same with normal appearing tubes bilaterally.  The right ovary contained a right ovarian cyst.  The left ovary appeared to be within normal limits.  The peritoneal surfaces were noted to be within normal limits.  The bowel was also noted to be within normal limits.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 44-year-old female who had an endometrial ablation done in May, which showed submucosal fibroids.  She had history of anemia and has been on iron therapy.  She started having bleeding three weeks ago with intermittent bouts of flooding.,She desired permanent and definitive therapy and therefore it was felt very appropriate to take the patient for a total abdominal hysterectomy.  The uterus, cervix, and right tube and ovary was sent to pathology for review.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's term.  She was taken to the operating room where a general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was examined under anesthesia with noted findings above.  She was placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife and was then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia.  With the second knife, the fascia was excised in the midline and extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with the Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline, the peritoneum was identified, entered bluntly and digitally.  Then the peritoneal incision was then extended superior and inferiorly with excellent visualization of the bladder.  The GYN Balfour was then placed.  A Lahey clamp was placed on the fundus of the uterus to pull the uterus into the operative field and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  Attention was then turned to the round ligaments bilaterally, which were tented up with Allis clamps and then a hemostat was poked through the avascular portion underneath the round ligament and the #O-tie was passed through and then tied down.  Then the round ligament was transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  The round ligaments were then skeletonized to create a window in the broad ligament.  The right infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated through the window created from the round ligaments and then the infundibular ligament on the right was loop tied and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and then transected and suture ligated with a #0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion.  It was noted to be hemostatic.  Attention was then turned to the left side, in which the uterovarian vessel was isolated and then tied with an #O-tie and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps, transected and suture ligated with a #0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion and noted to be hemostatic.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with Allis clamps, and then the bladder flap was created sharply with a Russian and Metzenbaum scissors.  Then the bladder was deflected off of the underlying cervix with blunt dissection with a moist Ray-Tec sponge down to the level of the cervix.,The uterine vessels were skeletonized bilaterally and then clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  In the similar fashion, the broad ligament down to the level of the caudal ligament, the uterosacral ligaments was clamped with curved Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated, and noted to be hemostatic.  The second Lahey clamp was then placed on the cervix.  The cervix was tented up and the pubocervical vesical fascia was transected with a long knife and then the vagina was entered with a double pointed scissors poked through well protecting posteriorly with a large malleable.  The cuff was then outlined.  The vaginal cuff was grasped with a Ochsner clamp and then the cervix, uterus, and the right tube and ovary were transected using the Jorgenson scissors.  The cuff outlined with Ochsner clamps.  The cuff was then painted with a Betadine soaked Ray-Tec sponge and the sponge was placed over the vagina.  The vaginal cuff was then closed with a #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion holding on to the beginning end on the right side as well as incorporating the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the cuff angles.  A long Allis was then used to grasp the mid portion of the cuff and a #0 Vicryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed in the mid portion of the cuff and tied down.  At this time, the abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  The suture that was used to close the cuff was then used to come back through the posterior peritoneum grabbing the uterosacral ligaments and the mid portion of the cuff, and then tied down to bring the cuff close and together.  Then, the right round ligament was pulled into the cuff and tied down with the #0 Vicryl that was used as a figure-of-eight stitch in the middle of the cuff.  The left round ligament was too small to reach the cuff.  The abdomen was then again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  The peritoneum was then re-peritonealized with a #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The GYN Balfour and all packing sponges were removed from the abdomen.  Then the abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated and the cuff and incision sites were once again reinspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The ______ was placed back into the hollow of the sacrum.  The omentum was then pulled over to top of the bowel and then the peritoneum was then closed with a #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion and then the fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin was closed with staples and dressing applied.  The patient was then examined at the end of the procedure.  The Betadine-soaked sponge was removed from the vagina.  The cuff was noted to be intact without bleeding and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and she was taken to the recovery in stable condition.  The patient will be followed throughout her hospital stay.","obstetrics / gynecology, tah, salpingo-oophorectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, abnormal uterine bleeding, endometrial ablatio, ochsner clamps, round ligaments, clamps, ligaments, cuff, salpingo, oophorectomy, hysterectomy, uterine, ablation, tubes, abdominal, anesthesia,"

She was then prepared and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with a scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline.  The fascial incision was then extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kochers with the underlying rectus muscle dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of this incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up with the underlying rectus muscle and dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus and left adnexa were then palpated and brought out into the surgical field.  The fundus of the uterus was grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges and the extension through GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  At this time, the patient's anatomy was surveyed and there was found to be a left hemorrhagic appearing adnexal mass.  Attention was first turned to the right round ligament, which was tented up with a Babcock and a small window was made beneath the round ligament with a hemostat.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected with the broad ligament being skeletonized on both sides.  Next, the right ________ was isolated bluntly as the patient had a previous RSO.  This was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  Attention was then turned to the left round ligament, which was tented up with the Babcock.  Small window was made beneath it and the broad ligament with hemostat was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected, and skeletonized with the aid of Metzenbaums.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament was then bluntly isolated.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  The bladder flap was then placed on tension with Allis clamps.  It was then dissected off of the lower uterine segment with the aid of Metzenbaum scissors and Russians.  It was then gently pushed off of lower uterine segment with the aid of a moist Ray-Tec.  The uterine arteries were then skeletonized bilaterally.,They were then clamped with straight Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The cardinal ligament and uterosacral complexes on both sides were then clamped with curved Kocher clamps.  These were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The lower uterine segment was then grasped with Lahey clamps, at which time the cervix was already visible.  It was then entered with the last transection.  The cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum and the uterus, cervix, and left adnexa were amputated off the vagina with the aid of Jorgenson scissors.  The angles of the vaginal cuff were then grasped with Kocher clamps.  A Betadine-soaked Ray-Tec was then pushed into the vagina and the vaginal cuff was closed with #0 Vicryl suture in a running lock fashion with care taken to transect the ipsilateral cardinal ligament, at which time the suction tip was changed and copious suction irrigation was performed.  Good hemostasis was appreciated.  A figure-of-eight suture in the center of the vaginal cuff was placed with #0 Vicryl.  This was tagged for later use.  The uterosacrals on both sides were incorporated into the vaginal cuff with the aid of #0 Vicryl suture.  The round ligaments were then pulled into the vaginal cuff using the figure-of-eight suture placed in the center of the vaginal cuff and these were tied in place.  The pelvis was then again copiously suctioned irrigated and hemostasis was appreciated.  The peritoneal surfaces were then reapproximated with the aid of #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.

Laparoscopic findings demonstrated a 8 cm x 10 cm smooth right ovarian cyst that was noted to be torsed twice.  Otherwise, the uterus, left tube and ovary, bowel, liver margins, appendix, and gallbladder were noted all to be within normal limits.  There was no noted blood in the pelvis.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE:,  The patient is a 26-year-old G1 P1 who presented to ABCD General Emergency Room with complaint of right lower quadrant pain since last night, which has been increasing in intensity.  The pain persisted despite multiple pain medications given in the Emergency Room.  The patient reports positive nausea and vomiting.  There was no vaginal bleeding or discharge.  There was no fevers or chills.  Her cultures done in the Emergency Room were pending.  The patient did have an ultrasound that demonstrated an 8 cm right ovarian cyst, questionable hemorrhagic.  The uterus and left ovary were within normal limits.  There was a positive flow noted to bilateral ovaries on ultrasound.  Therefore, it was felt appropriate to take the patient for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a possible oophorectomy.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position with the use of Allis strips and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter and she was examined under anesthesia and was noted to have the findings as above.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's vagina with excellent visualization of the cervix.  The cervix was grasped at 12 o'clock position with a single-toothed tenaculum and pulled into the operative field.  The uterus was then sounded to approximately 3.5 inches and then a uterine elevator was placed.  The vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made in the infraumbilical fold.  The Veress step needle was then placed into the abdomen while the abdomen was being tented up with towel clamp.  The CO2 was then turned on with unoccluded flow and excellent pressures.  This was continued till a normal symmetrical pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  Then, a #11 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed into the infraumbilical port without any difficulty and placement was confirmed by laparoscope.  Laparoscopic findings are as noted above.  A suprapubic incision was made with the knife and then a #12 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed in the suprapubic region under direct visualization.  Then, a grasper was used to untorse the ovary.  Then, a #12 mm port was placed in the right flank region under direct visualization using a LigaSure vessel sealing system.  The right tube and ovary were amputated and noted to be hemostatic.  The EndoCatch bag was then placed through the suprapubic port and the ovary was placed into the bag.  The ovary was too large to fit completely into the bag.  Therefore, a laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was used to aspirate the contents of the ovary while it was still inside the bag.,There was approximately 200 cc of fluid aspirated from the cyst.  This was a clear yellow fluid.  Then, the bag was closed and the ovary was removed from the suprapubic port.  The suprapubic port did have to be extended somewhat to allow for the removal of the ovary.  The trocar and sleeve were then placed back into the port.  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline using the Nezhat-Dorsey suction irrigator and the incision site was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was clear and clean.  ,Pictures were obtained.  The suprapubic port was then removed under direct visualization and then using a #0-vicyrl and UR6.  Two figure-of-eight sutures were placed in the fascia of suprapubic port and fascia was closed and the pneumoperitoneum was maintained after the sutures were placed.  Therefore, the peritoneal surface was noted to be hemostatic.  Therefore, the camera was removed.  All instruments were removed.  The abdomen was allowed to completely deflate and then the trocars were placed back through the sleeves of the right flank #12 port and the infraumbilical port and these were removed.  The infraumbilical port was examined and noted to have a small fascial defect which was repaired with #0-Vicryl and UR6.  The right flank area was palpated and there was no facial defect noted.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Care was taken to ensure that the arm was placed in a relaxed manner away from the body to facilitate exposure and to avoid nerve injury.,An elliptical incision was made to incorporate the nipple-areolar complex and the previous biopsy site.  The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further.  Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to the sternal border, superiorly to the clavicle, laterally to the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle.  The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi.  Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl.  The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely.  Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.,The axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein.  The highest point of axillary dissection was then marked with a long stitch for identification by the surgical pathologist.  The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection.  Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided.  The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein.  The long thoracic nerve was cleared identified lying against the chest and was carefully preserved.  The long thoracic nerve represented the posterior most aspect of the dissection.  As the axillary contents were dissected in the posterolateral axilla, the thoracodorsal nerve was identified and carefully preserved.  The dissection continued caudally until the entire specimen was freed and delivered from the operative field.  Copious water lavage was used to remove any debris, and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery.,Two Jackson-Pratt drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit.  The most posterior of the 2 was directed into the axilla and the other directed anteriorly across the pectoralis major.  These were secured to the skin using 2-0 silk, which was Roman-sandaled around the drain.,The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was applied.

She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.

A workup done in the emergency room revealed a beta-quant level of 1931 and an ultrasound showing an intrauterine pregnancy with a crown-rump length consistent with a 6-week and 2-day pregnancy.  No heart tones were visible.  On examination in the emergency room, a moderate amount of bleeding was noted.,Additionally, the cervix was noted to be 1 cm dilated.  These findings were discussed with the patient and options including surgical management via dilation and curettage versus management with misoprostol versus expected management were discussed with the patient.  After discussion of these options, the patient opted for a suction, dilation, and curettage.  The patient was described to the patient in detail including risks of infection, bleeding, injury to surrounding organs including risk of perforation.  Informed consent was obtained prior to proceeding with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthesia was administered without difficulty.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion in lithotomy position.  A weighted speculum was placed.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a single tooth tenaculum.  At this time, a 7-mm suction curettage was advanced into the uterine cavity without difficulty and was used to suction contents of the uterus.  Following removal of the products of conception, a sharp curette was advanced into the uterine cavity and was used to scrape the four walls of the uterus until a gritty texture was noted.  At this time, the suction curette was advanced one additional time to suction any remaining products.  All instruments were removed.  Hemostasis was visualized.  The patient was stable at the completion of the procedure.  Sponge, lap, and instrument counts were correct.","obstetrics / gynecology, missed abortion, intrauterine pregnancy, dilation, curettage, suction, intrauterine"

An ultrasound suggestive with a mass of 8 cm, did not respond to suppression with norethindrone acetate and on repeat ultrasound following the medical treatment, the ovarian neoplasm persisted and did not decreased in size.,PROCEDURE:  ,Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in lithotomy position, prepped and draped.  A low transverse incision was made down to and through to the rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was put laterally.  The inferior epigastric arteries were identified bilaterally, doubly clamped and tied with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The rectus muscle was then split transversally and the peritoneum was split transversally as well.  The left adnexal mass was identified and large bowel was attached to the mass and Dr. Zuba from General Surgery dissected the large bowel adhesions and separated them from the adnexal mass.  The ureter was then traced and found to be free of the mass and free of the infundibulopelvic ligament.  The infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated, entered via blunt dissection.  A #0 Vicryl suture was put into place, doubly clamped with curved Heaney clamps, cut with curved Mayo scissors and #0 Vicryl fixation suture put into place.  Curved Heaney clamps were then used to remove the remaining portion of the ovary from its attachment to the uterus and then #0 Vicryl suture was put into place.  Pathology was called to evaluate the mass for potential malignancy and the pathology's verbal report at the time of surgery was that this was a benign lesion.  Irrigation was used.  Minimal blood loss at the time of surgery was noted.  Sigmoid colon was inspected in place in physiologic position of the cul-de-sac as well as small bowel omentum.  Instrument, needle, and sponge counts were called for and found to be correct.  The peritoneum was closed with #0 Vicryl continuous running locking suture.  The rectus sheath was closed with #0 Vicryl continuous running locking suture.  A DonJoy Pain-Buster Pain Management System was placed through the skin into the subcutaneous space and the skin was closed with staples.  Final instrument needle counts were called for and found to be correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss and transferred to recovery area in satisfactory condition.","obstetrics / gynecology, lysis of pelvic adhesions, salpingooophorectomy, pain-buster pain management system, adnexal mass, pelvic laparotomy, pelvic adhesions, rectus sheath, vicryl sutures, adhesions, pelvic"
2551, A sample note on pre-eclampsia & eclampsia., Obstetrics / Gynecology, Pre-Eclampsia & Eclampsia ,"PRE-ECLAMPSIA, is a very serious condition unique to pregnancy in which blood pressure, the kidneys and the central nervous system are compromised.  It usually occurs from the 20th week of pregnancy to 7 days postpartum.  The cause is unknown.  It is also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension or toxemia of pregnancy.,ECLAMPSIA, is the end-stage of the pre-eclampsia process.  The vast majority of women who develop pre-eclampsia are pregnant with their first child and are towards the end of their child-bearing years.  There are identifiable risk factors for developing pre-eclampsia:  family history of pre-eclampsia, previous pregnancy with pre-eclampsia, multiple gestation, and a hydatiform mole (an intrauterine growth that mimics pregnancy).  A chronic high blood pressure and underlying blood vessel disease increases the risk.  Pre-eclampsia ranges from mild to severe to eclampsia as the end-stage.  Untreated pre-eclampsia can result in a stroke, fluid-build up around the lungs, kidney failure, death of baby and death of mother.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,MILD PRE-ECLAMPSIA:,*  Significant blood pressure increase even if you are still within the normal blood pressure limits.,*  Swelling in the face, hands and feet which worsens in the a.m.,*  Gaining more than a pound a week, especially in the last trimester.,*  Routine prenatal checkup reveals protein in the urine.,*  Seizures are possible.,SEVERE PRE-ECLAMPSIA:,*  More blood pressure increase.,*  Further swelling in face, hands and feet.,*  Visual disturbances.,*  Headache.,*  Irritability.,*  Abdominal pain.,*  Tiredness.,*  Decreased urination.,*  Seizures possible.,*  Nausea and vomiting.,ECLAMPSIA:,*  Symptoms worsen.,*  Seizures.,*  Muscle twitches.,*  Coma.,TREATMENT:,*  Diagnosis - blood tests, urinalysis, blood pressure monitoring.,*  Mild preeclampsia can be treated at home.  Severe symptoms require hospitalization and possible early delivery of the baby, often by cesarean section.,*  Daily weighing.,*  Daily monitoring for protein in urine.,*  Medications to lower blood pressure if preeclampsia is severe.,*  Magnesium sulfate or other anti-seizure drugs may be necessary to prevent seizures.,*  Get lots of rest! Lay on your left side to help circulation.,*  Follow any dietary advice given by your doctor.,*  Get regular prenatal checkups! Eat a nutritious diet and take your vitamin supplements.,*  Never take any medications that are not prescribed or recommended by your physician.,*  Call the office if your headaches become severe, you have visual disturbances or if you gain more than 3 pounds in 24 hours.,RESTRICTING CAFFEINE:,You should reduce your intake of caffeine by cutting back on coffee and other caffeinated beverages like soda.

She is complaining of a three-month history of lower abdominal pain for which she has been to the emergency room twice.  She describes the pain as bilateral, intermittent, and non-radiating.  It decreases slightly when she eats and increases with activity.  She states the pain when it comes can last for half-a-day.  It is not associated with movement, but occasionally the pain was so bad that it was associated with vomiting.  She has tried LactAid, which initially helped, but then the pain returned.  She has tried changing her diet and Pepcid AC.  She was seen at XYZ where blood work was done.  At that time, she had a normal white count and a normal H&H.  She was given muscle relaxants, which did not work.,Approximately two weeks ago, she was seen in the emergency room at XYZ where a pelvic ultrasound was done.  This showed a 1.9 x 1.4-cm cyst on the right with no free fluid.  The left ovary and uterus appeared normal.  Two days later, the pain resolved and she has not had a recurrence.  She denies constipation and diarrhea.  She has had some hot flashes, but has not taken her temperature.,In addition, she states that her periods have been very irregular coming between four and six weeks.  They are associated with cramping which she is not happy about.,She has never had a pelvic exam.  She states she is not sexually active and declined having her mother leave the room, so she was not questioned regarding this without her mother present.  She is very interested in not having pain with her periods and if this was a cyst that caused her pain, she is interested in starting birth control pills to prevent this from happening again.,PAST MEDICAL HX:  ,Pneumonia in 2002, depression diagnosed in 2005, and seizures as an infant.,PAST SURGICAL HX:  ,Plastic surgery on her ear after a dog bite in 1997.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Zoloft 50 mg a day and LactAid.,ALLERGIES:  ,NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HX: , She enjoys cooking and scrapbooking.

I expressed my doubt that her pain was secondary to this 1.9-cm ovarian cyst given the fact that there was no free fluid surrounding this.  However, given that she has irregular periods and they are painful for her, I think it is reasonable to start her on a low-dose birth control pill.

2561, A very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer.  , Obstetrics / Gynecology, Metastatic Ovarian Cancer - Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Metastatic ovarian cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic.  She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month.  She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000.  Her ANC was 0.5.  She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots.  She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.,Over the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily.  Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions.  She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fevers or chills.  However, she was complaining of chest pain.  She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it was nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.  There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox.  There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.,At this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY,1.

The patient's uterus is intact, bladder is intact.,HISTORY: , The patient is an approximately 25-year-old Caucasian female with gravida-4, para-1-0-2-1.  The patient's last menstrual period was in December of 2002 with a foreseeable due date on 09/16/03 confirmed by ultrasound.,The patient has a history of herpes simplex virus to which there is no active prodromal and no evidence of lesions.  The patient has a history of IVDA and contracted hepatitis C with slightly elevated liver transaminases.  The patient had been seen through our office for prenatal care.  The patient is on Valtrex.  The patient was found to be 3 cm about 40%, 0 to 9 engaged.  Bag of waters was ruptured.  She was on Pitocin.  She was contracting appropriately for a couple of hours or so with appropriate ________.  There was no cervical change noted.  Most probably because there was a sink vertex and that the head was too large to descend into the pelvis.  The patient was advised of this and we recommended cesarean section.  She agreed.  We discussed the surgery, foreseeable risks and complications, alternative treatment, the procedure itself, and recovery in layman's terms.  The patient's questions were answered.  I personally made sure that she understood every aspect of the consent and that she was comfortable with the understanding of what would transpire.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was then taken back to operative suite.  She was given anesthetic and sterilely prepped and draped.  Pfannenstiel incision was used.  A second knife was used to carry the incision down to the anterior rectus fascia.  Anterior rectus fascia was incised in the midline and carried bilaterally and the fascia was lifted off the underlying musculature.  The rectus muscles were separated.  The patient's peritoneum tented up towards the umbilicus and we entered the abdominal cavity.  There was a very thin lower uterine segment.  There seemed to be quite a large baby.  The patient had a small nick in the uterus.  Following the blunt end of the bladder knife going through the innermost layer of the myometrium and into the endometrial cavity, clear amniotic fluid was obtained.  A blunt low transverse cervical incision was made.  Following this, we placed a ________ on the very large fetal head.  The head was delivered following which we were able to deliver a large baby girl, 9 lb, good at tone and cry.  The patient then underwent removal of the placenta after the cord blood and ABG were taken.  The patient's uterus was examined.  There appeared to be no retained products.  The patient's uterine incision was reapproximated and sutured with #0 Vicryl in a running non-interlocking fashion, the second imbricating over the first.  The patient's uterus was hemostatic.  Bladder flap was reapproximated with #0 Vicryl.  The patient then underwent an irrigation at every level of closure and the patient was quite hemostatic.  We reapproximated the rectus musculature with care being taken not to incorporate any underlying structures.  The patient had three interrupted sutures of this.  The fascia was reapproximated with two stitches of #0 Vicryl going from each apex towards the midline.  The Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #0 gut.  There was noted no fascial defects and the skin was closed with #0 Vicryl.,Prior to closing the abdominal cavity, the uterus appeared to be intact and bladder appeared to have clear urine and appeared to be intact.  The patient was hemostatic.  All counts were correct and the patient tolerated the procedure well.

A decision was made to take her for a C-section early.,FINDINGS: , The patient had an enlarged fibroid uterus with a large anterior fibroid with large varicosities, normal appearing tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  There was a live male infant in the ROA position with Apgars of 9 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes and a weight of 5 lb 4 oz.,PROCEDURE: , Prior to the procedure, an informed consent was obtained.  The patient who previously been interested in a tubal ligation refused the tubal ligation prior to surgery.  She states that she and her husband are fully disgusted and that they changed their mind and they were adamant about this.  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthetic with Astramorph was administered.  She was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was tested, it was found to be inadequate and a general anesthetic was administered.  Once the general anesthetic was administered and the patient was asleep, the previous incision was removed with the skin knife and this incision was then carried through an underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was incised in the midline with a second knife.  This incision was then extended laterally in both directions with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of this fascial incision was then dissected off to the underlying rectus muscle bluntly without using Ochsner clamps.  It was then dissected in the midline with Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of this incision was then addressed in a similar manner.  The rectus muscles were then separated in the midline with a hemostat.  The rectus muscles were separated further in the midline with Mayo scissors superiorly and inferiorly.  Next, the peritoneum was grasped with two hemostats, tented up and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended inferiorly with the Metzenbaum scissors, being careful to avoid the bladder and the peritoneal incision was extended bluntly.  Next, the bladder blade was placed.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, tenting up with Allis clamps and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended laterally in both directions and a bladder flap was created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted.  Next, the uterine incision was made with a second knife and the uterus was entered with the blunt end of the knife.  Next, the uterine incision was extended laterally in both directions with the banded scissors.  Next, the infant's head and body were delivered without difficulty.  There was multiple section on the abdomen.  The cord was clamped and cut.  Section of cord was collected for gases and the cord blood was collected.  Next, the placenta was manually extracted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The edges of the uterine incision were then identified with Allis _______ clamps.  The uterine incision was reapproximated with #0 chromic in a running locked fashion and a second layer of the same suture was used to obtain excellent hemostasis.  One figure-of-eight with #0 chromic was used in one area to prevent a questionable hematoma from expanding along the varicosity for the anterior fibroid.  After several minutes of observation, the hematoma was seem to be non-expanding.  The uterus was replaced in the abdomen.  The uterine incision was reexamined and seem to be continuing to be hemostatic.  The pelvic gutters were then cleared of all clots and debris.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The peritoneum was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The rectus muscles reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a single interrupted stitch.  The fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion and the skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x3.  The patient was then taken to Recovery in stable condition and she will be followed for immediate postoperative course in the hospital.",

Otherwise normal appearing uterus and bilateral tubes and ovaries.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthesia was obtained by Dr. X without difficulties.  The patient was placed in supine position with leftward tilt.  Fetal heart tones were checked and were 140s, and she was prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.  At this time, a Pfannenstiel skin incision made with a scalpel and carried down to the underlying fascia with electrocautery.  The fascia was nicked sharply in the midline.  The fascial incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kocher x2, elevated, and rectus muscles dissected sharply with the use of Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the superior aspect of the fascial incision.  Fascia was grasped, elevated, and rectus muscles dissected off sharply.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum was identified, grasped, and entered sharply and the peritoneal incision extended inferiorly and superiorly with good visualization of bladder.  Bladder blade was inserted.  Vesicouterine peritoneum was tented up and a bladder flap was created using Metzenbaum scissors.  Bladder blade was reinserted to effectively protect the bladder from the operative field and the lower uterine segment incised in a transverse U-shaped fashion with the scalpel.  Uterine incision was extended laterally and manually.  Membranes were ruptured and bright yellow clear amniotic fluid was noted.  Infant's head was in a floating position, able to flex the head, push against the incision, and then easily brought it to the field vertex.  Nares and mouth were suctioned with bulb suction.  Remainder of the infant was delivered atraumatically.  The infant was very pale upon delivery.  Cord was doubly clamped and cut and immediately handed to the awaiting intensive care nursery team.  An 8 cm segment of the tube was doubly clamped and transected.  Cord gases were obtained.  Cord was then cleansed, laid on a clean laparotomy sponge, and cord blood was drawn for hematocrit measurements.  At this time, it was noted that the cord was significantly yellow stained as well as the placenta.  At this time, the placenta was delivered via gentle traction on the cord and exterior uterine massage.  Uterus was exteriorized and cleared off all clots and debris with dry laparotomy sponge and the lower uterine segment was closed with 1-0 chromic in a running locked fashion.  Two areas of oozing were noted and separate figure-of-eight sutures were placed to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, the uterine incision was hemostatic.  The bladder was examined and found to be well below the level of the incision repair.  Tubes and ovaries were examined and found to be normal.  The patient was again asked if she desires permanent sterilization of which she agrees and therefore the right fallopian tube was identified and followed out to the fimbriated end and grasped at the mid portion with a Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx was divided with electrocautery and a 4-cm segment of tube was doubly tied and transected with a 3-cm segment of tube removed.  Hemostasis was noted.  Then, attention was turned to the left fallopian tube which in similar fashion was grasped and brought out through the fimbriated end and grasped the midline portion with Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx was incised and 3-4 cm tube doubly tied, transected, and excised and excellent hemostasis was noted.  Attention was returned to the uterine incision which is seemed to be hemostatic and uterus was returned to the abdomen.  Gutters were cleared off all clots and debris.  Lower uterine segments were again re-inspected and found to be hemostatic.  Sites of tubal sterilization were also visualized and were hemostatic.  At this time, the peritoneum was grasped with Kelly clamps x3 and closed with running 3-0 Vicryl suture.  Copious irrigation was used.  Rectus muscle belly was examined and found to be hemostatic and tacked and well approximated in the midline.  At this time, the fascia was closed using 0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Manual palpation confirms thorough and adequate closure of the fascial layer.  Copious irrigation was again used.  Hemostasis noted, and skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, needle, and instrument counts were correct x3 and the patient was sent to the recovery room awake and stable condition.  Infant assumed the care of the intensive care nursery team and being followed and workup up for isoimmunization and fetal anemia.  The patient will be followed for her severe right upper quadrant pain post delivery.  If she continues to have pain, may need a surgical consult for gallbladder and/or angiogram for evaluation of right kidney and questionable venous plexus.  This all will be relayed to Dr. Y, her primary obstetrician who was on call starting this morning at 7 a.m. through the weekend.","obstetrics / gynecology, intrauterine pregnancy, rh isoimmunization, primary low transverse cesarean section, bilateral tubal sterilization, pfannenstiel skin incision, fascial incision, uterine incision, fetal anemia, permanent sterilization, rectus muscles, incision, tubes, cord, "

A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made removing the old scar with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was excised in the midline extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  There was noted dense adhesions at this point as well as a wire mesh was noted.  The anterior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle superiorly was opened with a hemostat.  The peritoneum was identified and entered bluntly digitally.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly up to the level of the mesh.  Then, inferiorly using the knife, the adhesions were taken down and the bladder was identified and the peritoneum incision extended inferiorly to the level of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted and vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and tented up with Allis clamps and bladder flap was created sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted to protect the bladder and the uterine incision was made with a first knife and then extended laterally with the Bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was noted to be clear.  At this point, upon examining the intrauterine contents, the baby was noted to be breached.  The right foot was identified and then the baby was delivered from the double footling breach position without any difficulty.  The cord was clamped and the baby was then handed off to awaiting pediatricians.  The placenta cord gases were obtained and the placenta was then manually extracted from the uterus.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  Then, the uterine incision was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a double closure stitch fashion, first layer in locking stitch fashion and the second layer an imbricating layer.  Attention at this time was turned to the tubes bilaterally.,Both tubes were isolated and followed all the way to the fimbriated end and tented up with the Babcock clamp.  The hemostat was probed through the mesosalpinx in the avascular area and then a section of tube was clamped off with two hemostats and then transected with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The ends was then burned with the cautery and then using a #2-0 Vicryl suture tied down.  Both tube sections were noted to be hemostatic and the tubes were then sent to pathology for review.  The uterus was then replaced back into the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was then once again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The bladder flap was then replaced back into the uterus with #3-0 interrupted sutures.  The peritoneum was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Then, the area at the fascia where the mesh had been cut and approximately 0.5 cm portion was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple stitch fashion.  The fascia was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous layer and Scarpa's fascia were repaired with a #3-0 Vicryl.  Then, the skin edges were reapproximated using sterile clips.  The dressing was placed.  The uterus was then cleared of all clots and debris manually.  Then, the patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle, counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to recovery in sable condition.  She will be followed up throughout her hospital stay.",

Infant was in a vertex, right occiput anterior position.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 19-year-old G1 P0 at 41 and 1/7th weeks' intrauterine pregnancy.  She presented at mid night on 08/22/03 complaining of spontaneous rupture of membranes, which was confirmed in Labor and Delivery.  The patient had a positive group beta strep colonization culture and was started on penicillin.  The patient was also started on Pitocin protocol at that time.  The patient was monitored throughout the morning showing some irregular contractions every 5 to 6 minutes and then eventually no contractions on the monitor.  IUPC was placed without difficulty and contractions appeared to be regular, however, they were inadequate amount of the daily units.  The patient was given a rest from the Pitocin.  She walked and had a short shower.  The patient was then placed back on Pitocin with IUPC in place and we were unable to achieve adequate contractions.  Maximum cervical dilation was 5 cm, 80% effaced, negative 2 station, and cephalic position.  At the time of C-section, the patient had been ruptured for over 24 hours and it was determined that she would not progress in her cervical dilation, as there was suspected macrosomia on ultrasound.  Options were discussed with the patient and family and it was determined that we will take her for C-section today.  Consent was signed.  All questions were answered with Dr. X present.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where a spinal anesthetic was placed.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with left upward tilt.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion and her spinal anesthetic was found to adequate.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made with a first scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second scalpel.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using curved Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Ochsner and Kocher clamps and elevated off the rectus muscles.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision where Kocher clamps were used to elevate the fascia off the underlying rectus muscle.  The rectus muscle was separated in the midline bluntly.  The underlying peritoneum was tented up with Allis clamps and incised using Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then bluntly stretched.  The bladder blade was placed.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, tented up with Allis' and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted in the lower uterine segment.  A low transverse uterine incision was made with a second scalpel.  The uterine incision was extended laterally bluntly.  The bladder blade was removed and the infant's head was delivered with the assistance of a vacuum.  Infant's nose and mouth were bulb suctioned and the body was delivered atraumatically.  There was, of note, an umbilical cord around the leg tightly x1.,Cord was clamped and cut.  Infant was handed to the waiting pediatrician.  Cord gas was sent for pH as well as blood typing.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was grasped circumferentially with Alfred clamps and closed with #0-Chromic in a running locked fashion.  A second layer of imbricating stitch was performed using #0-Chromic suture to obtain excellent hemostasis.  The uterus was returned to the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The rectus muscle was loosely approximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a single interrupted fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous Scarpa's fascia was then closed with #2-0 plain gut.  The skin was then closed with staples.  The incision was dressed with sterile dressing and bandage.

The uterus appeared to be intact.  This patient is a 26-year-old Caucasian female.  The patient is well known to the OB/GYN clinic.  The patient had two previous C-sections.  She appears to be in probably early labor.  She had an amniocentesis early today.  She is contracting regularly about every three minutes.  The contractions are painful and getting much more so since the amniocentesis.  The patient had fetal lung maturity noted.  The patient also has probable IUGR as none of her babies have been over 4 lb.  The patient's baby appears to be somewhat small.  The patient suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which has left her wheelchair bound.  The patient has had a spinal fusion, however, family planning is definitely complete per the patient.  The patient refuses trial labor.  The patient and I discussed the consent.  She understands the foreseeable risks and complications, alternative treatment of the procedure itself, and recovery.  Her questions were answered.  The patient also understands that when we occlude her tube that she is at risk for failure of this part of the procedure, which would result in either an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy.  The patient understands this and would like to try our best.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken back to the operative suite.  She was given general anesthetic by Department of Anesthesiology.  Once again, in layman's terms, the patient understands the risks.  The patient had the informed consent reviewed and understood.  The patient has had a Pfannenstiel incision, which was slightly bent towards the right side favoring the right side.  The patient had the first knife went through this incision.  The second knife was used to go to the level of fascia.  The fascia was very thin, ruddy in appearance, and with abundant scar tissue.  The fascia was incised.  Following this, we were able to see the peritoneum.  There was really no obvious rectus abdominal muscles noted.  They were very weak, atrophic, and thin.  The patient has the peritoneum tented up.  We entered the abdominal cavity.  The bladder flap was then entered into the anterior abdominal wall and to the underlying area of the fascia.  The bladder flap was then entered into the uterus as well.  There are some bladder adhesions.  We removed these adhesions and we removed the bladder of the fascia.  We dissected the bladder of the lower segment.  We made a small nick on the lower segment.  We were able to utilize the blunt end of the knife to enter into the uterine cavity.  The baby was in occiput transverse position with the ear being cocked at such a position as well.  The patient's baby was delivered without difficulty.  It was a 4 lb and 10 oz baby girl who vigorously cried well.  There was a prolapse of the umbilical cord just below the chin as well and this may be attributed to the decelerations we caught on the monitor strip right before we decided to have her undergo resection.  The patient's placenta was delivered.  There was no retained placenta.  The uterine incision was closed with two layers of #0 Vicryl, the second layer imbricating over the first.  The patient on the right side had the inferior epigastric artery and the vein just underneath the peritoneum easily visualized.  Then we ligated this as there was bleeding and oozing.  The patient had the Indigo Carmine instilled into the bladder with some saline about 300 cc.  The 400 cc was instilled.  The bladder appears to be intact.  The bladder did require extensive dissection of the fascia in order to be able to get a proper fascial edges for closure and dissection of the lower uterine segment.  There was some oozing around the area of the bladder.  We placed an Avitene there.  The two Hulka clips were placed perpendicular to going across each fallopian tube into the mesosalpinx.  The patient has two clips on each side.  There was excellent tubal occlusion and placement.  The uterus was placed back into the abdominal cavity.  We rechecked again.  The tubal placement was excellent.  It did not involve the round ligaments, uterosacral ligaments, the uteroovarian ligaments, and the tube into the mesosalpinx.  The patient then underwent further examination.  Hemostasis appeared to be good.  The fascia was reapproximated with short running intervals of #0 Vicryl across the fascia.  We took care not to get into any bleeders and to make sure that the fascia was indeed closed as best as it was possible.  The Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #0 gut.  The skin was reapproximated then as well via subcutaneous closure.  The patient's sponge and needle counts found to be correct.  Uterus appeared to be normal prior to closure.  Bladder appeared to be normal.  The patient's blood loss is 600 cc.","obstetrics / gynecology, intrauterine growth rate, charcot-marie-tooth disease, amniocentesis, c-sections, trial labor, low transverse cervical cesarean section, lysis of adhesions, dissection, bladder, abdominal wall, fascia, hulka clips, bilateral tubal occlusion, intrauterine, transverse, uterus, abdominal, "

The patient was placed in the supine position under spinal anesthesia with a Foley catheter in place and she was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A low abdominal transverse skin incision was constructed and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue through the anterior rectus fascia.  Bleeding points were snapped and coagulated along the way.  The fascia was opened transversally and was dissected sharply and bluntly from the underlying rectus muscles.  These were divided in the midline revealing the peritoneum, which was opened vertically.  The uterus was in mid position.  The bladder flap was incised elliptically and reflected caudad.  A low transverse hysterotomy incision was then constructed and extended bluntly.  Amniotomy revealed clear amniotic fluid.  A live born vigorous male infant was then delivered from the right occiput transverse position.  The infant breathed and cried spontaneously.  The nares and pharynx were suctioned.  The umbilical cord was clamped and divided and the infant was passed to the waiting neonatal team.  Cord blood samples were obtained.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was eventrated for closure.  The edges of the uterine incision were grasped with Pennington clamps and closure was carried out in standard two-layer technique using 0 Vicryl suture with the second layer imbricating the first.  Hemostasis was completed with an additional figure-of-eight suture of 0 Vicryl.  The cornual sac and gutters were irrigated.  The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.

The decision for C-section was made.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a supine position with a slight left lateral tilt and she was then prepped and draped in usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  The patient was then given general anesthesia and once this was completed, first knife was used to make a low transverse incision extending down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion with the use of curved Mayo scissors.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection was then completed both caudally and cephalically.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center and extended in a vertical fashion.  Peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  The bladder blade was put in place.  The bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum scissors and dissected away caudally.  The second knife was used to make a low transverse incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of the fetus.  The first fetus was vertex.  The fluid was clear.  The head was delivered followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut.  The newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician and nursery personnel.  The second fluid was ruptured.  It was the clear fluid as well.  The presenting part was brought down to be vertex.  The head was delivered followed by the rest of the body and the cord was doubly clamped and cut, and newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician in addition of the nursery personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained from both of the cords with careful identification of A and B. Once this was completed, the placenta was delivered and handed off for further inspection by Pathology.  At this time, it was noted at the uterus was adhered to the abdominal wall by approximately of 3 cm x 3 cm thick uterine adhesion and this was needed to be released by sharp dissection.  Then, there were multiple omental adhesions on the surface of the uterus itself.  This needed to be released as well as on the abdominal wall and then the uterus could be externalized.  The lining was wiped clean of any remaining blood and placental fragments and the edges of the uterus were grasped in four quadrants with Kocher and continuous locking stitch of 0 chromic was used to re-approximate the uterine incision, with the second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam underneath.  The right fallopian tube was grasped with a Babcock, it was doubly tied off with 0 chromic and the knuckle portion was then sharply incised and cauterized.  The same technique was completed on the left side with the knuckle portion cut off and cauterized as well.  The defect on the uterine surface was reinforced with 0 Vicryl in a baseball stitch to create adequate Hemostasis.  Interceed was placed over this area as well.  The abdominal cavity was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood.  The edges of the peritoneum were grasped with hemostats and a continuous locking stitch was used to re-approximate abdominal rectus muscles as well as the peritoneal edges.  The abdominal rectus muscle was irrigated.  The corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl started on both corners and overlapped on the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the subcutaneous tissue.  Skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Uterus was evacuated of any remaining blood vaginally.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.

Following completion of the fulguration, there was good hemostasis.  The remainder of the bladder was without evidence of significant abnormality.  Both ureteral orifices were visualized and noted to drain freely of clear urine.  The bladder was filled and the resectoscope was removed.  A 22-French 3-way Foley catheter was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The balloon was inflated to 30 mL.  The catheter with sterile continuous irrigation and was noted to drain clear irrigant.  The patient was then removed from lithotomy position.  He was in stable condition.","urology, turbt, bladder tumor, cystoscopic, resectoscope, hemostasis, foley catheter, tumor, bladder, lithotomy, transurethral, resection, hematuria,"

He has had problem with urinary retention and bladder stones in the past.  He will need to have transurethral resection of prostate to alleviate the above-mentioned problems.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Formation of urethral strictures.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was identified, after which he was taken into the operating room.  General LMA anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given prophylactic antibiotic in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then positioned, prepped and draped.  Cystoscopy was then performed by using a #26-French continuous flow resectoscopic sheath and a visual obturator.  The prostatic urethra appeared to be moderately hypertrophied due to the lateral lobes and a large median lobe.  The anterior urethra was normal without strictures or lesions.  The bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula.  There is a very bladder diverticula located in the right posterior bladder wall just proximal to the trigone.  Using the ***** resection apparatus and a right angle resection loop, the prostate was resected initially at the area of the median lobe.  Once the median lobe has completely resected, the left lateral lobe and then the right lateral lobes were taken down.  Once an adequate channel had been achieved, the prostatic specimen was retrieved from the bladder by using an Ellik evacuator.  A 3-mm bar electrode was then introduced into the prostate to achieve perfect hemostasis.  The sheath was then removed under direct vision and a #24-French Foley catheter was then inserted atraumatically with pinkish irrigation fluid obtained.  The patient tolerated the operation well.","urology, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cystoscopy, foley catheter, turp, transurethral, bladder, bladder diverticula, electrosurgical, obturator, prostate, resectoscopic, transurethral resection, urinary retention, resection of the prostate, transurethral electrosurgical resection, anesthesia, hyperplasia, resection, prostatic"

39, The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem. , Urology, Testicular Pain ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Testicular pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a history of abrupt onset of left testicular pain at 11:30 this morning.  He was unable to walk and would not stand upright, and had fairly significant discomfort, so the parents checked his panel because of it.  Because of this, they took him to Emergency Department, at which time, he had no swelling noted initially, but very painful.  He had no voiding or stooling problems.  No nausea, vomiting or fever.  Family denies trauma or dysuria.  At that time, he was going to get an ultrasound done, but the mother said that all of sudden the patient stated the pain had resolved.  He has had hot chocolate this morning at 10:30 in the morning and water around 2:30 in the morning.  He has not had any pain since but states that he has had pain in the past, not as long and states there was a twisting sensation.  He has no recent cold or flu, although he had rhinorrhea about 3 weeks ago.  He is on no medications and he is here for evaluation.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  The patient has no known allergies.  He is term delivery via spontaneous vaginal delivery.  He has had no problems or hospitalizations with circumcision.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , He has had no previous surgeries.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  All 14-point review of systems were negative except for the above left testicular pain and the history of possible upper respiratory infection about 2 to 3 weeks ago.,IMMUNIZATIONS: , Up-to-date.,FAMILY HISTORY: , The patient lives at home with both parents who are Spanish speaking.  He is not in school.,MEDICATIONS:,  He is on no medications.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On physical exam, weight is 15.9 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient is a cooperative little boy.,HEENT:  Normal head and neck exam.  No oral or nasal discharge.,NECK:  Without masses.,CHEST:  Without masses.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIAC:  Without murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  No masses or tenderness.  His scrotum did not have any swelling at the present time.  There was only minimal discomfort with palpation at the left inguinal area, but no masses were noted.  No palpable nodules such as appendix testis and no swelling was noted and he had mild epididymal swelling only.  His left testis was slightly harder than the right, but this was not very significant.,EXTREMITIES:  He had full range of motion in all 4 extremities.,SKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.,LABORATORY DATA: , Ultrasound was obtained today showing no blood flow or poor blood flow on the left except for increased blood flow to the epididymis on the study done at about 1330 hours, and second one done around 1630 hours was normal flow, possible increased flow on the left.  This is personally reviewed by me.  The right was normal.  No masses were appreciated.  There was some mild change in echotexture on the left on the initial study, which had apparently resolved on the second, but may be due to the technical aspects of the study.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem.  If the patient has indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hours and as such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testes fixation if the torsion is found.  I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents.  Procedure itself with potential complications, risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery including that the torsion could occur again, although it is less likely after the surgical fixation procedure.  The parents understand and wished to proceed.  We will schedule this later today emergently.",

He was found to have a new tumor last fall, and cystoscopy in November showed Ta papillary-appearing lesion inside the bladder neck anteriorly.  The patient had coronary artery disease and required revascularization, which occurred at the end of December prior to the tumor resection.  He is fully recovered and cleared by Cardiology and taken to the operating room at this time for TURBT.,FINDINGS: , Cystoscopy of the anterior and posterior urethra was within normal limits.  From 12 o'clock to 4 o'clock inside the bladder neck, there was a papillary tumor with some associated blood clot.  This was completely resected.  There was an abnormal dysplastic area in the left lateral wall that was biopsied, and the remainder of the bladder mucosa appeared normal.  The ureteral orifices were in the orthotopic location.  Prostate was 15 g and benign on rectal examination, and there was no induration of the bladder.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite, and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained, placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  He had been given oral ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.  Rectal bimanual examination was performed with the findings described.  Cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23-French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings described.  A barbotage urine was obtained for cytology.  The cystoscope was removed and a #24-French continuous flow resectoscope sheath was introduced over visual obturator and cold cup biopsy forceps introduced.  Several biopsies were taken from the tumor and sent to the tumor bank.  I then introduced the Iglesias resectoscope element and resected all the exophytic tumor and the lamina propria.  Because of the Ta appearance, I did not intentionally dissect deeper into the muscle.  Complete hemostasis was obtained.  All the chips were removed with an Ellik evacuator.  Using the cold cup biopsy forceps, biopsy was taken from the dysplastic area in the left bladder and hemostasis achieved.  The irrigant was clear.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the resectoscope was removed and a #24-French Foley catheter was placed for efflux of clear irrigant.

The patient also has family status complete and desired infertility.  The patient was scheduled for elective left spermatocelectomy and bilateral partial vasectomy.,FINDINGS: , At this time of the surgery, significant left-sided spermatocele was noted encompassing almost the entirety of the left epididymis with only minimal amount of normal appearing epididymis remaining.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room.  A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.,The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach.  A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum.  Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field.  The left testicle was examined.  A large spermatocele was noted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele.  Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis.  Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis.  Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord.  The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors.  Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends.  Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position.  The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic.  Attention was then turned to the right side.  The vas was palpated in the scrotum.  A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field.  A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat.  Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery.  Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum.  A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision.  Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied.  The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition.  He was given prescriptions for doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d., for five days and Vicodin ES 1 p.o. q.4h. p.r.n., pain, #30 for pain.

He was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising PSA.  After that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization.  One year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy.  He had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified.  There were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time.  He wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly.  I took him to the operating room on January 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck.  We both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him.  I felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.,FINDINGS: , At exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel.  The bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally.  The opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment.  Because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, I elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line.  He was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis.  A generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure.  We began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips.  An identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.,We began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries.  This was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.  We essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally.  We then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder.  There was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum.  We then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum.  We then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field.  Bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.,We then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon.  This allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,We matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches.  The stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the Malecot to the left lower quadrant.  A Large JP drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the Indiana pouch.,The rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 Prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 450 mL, and the patient received no packed red blood cells.  The final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct.  The patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","urology, radiation cystitis, voiding dysfunction, retropubic prostatectomy, salvage radiation therapy, salvage cystectomy, indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, omental pedicle flap, ligasure, gia, stapler, gia stapler, vicryl sutures, radiation therapy, silk sutures, bladder, therapy, sutures, endotracheal, "

The patient says it does bother him on and off, has occasional pain and discomfort with it, has difficulty with putting clothes on etc. and wanted to remove.  Options such as watchful waiting, removal of the spermatocele or needle drainage were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, risk of infection, scrotal pain, and testicular pain were discussed.  The patient was told that his scrotum may enlarge in the postoperative period for about a month and it will settle down.  The patient was told about the risk of recurrence of spermatocele.  The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with removal.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient's scrotal area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made measuring about 2 cm in size.  The incision was carried through the dartos through the scrotal sac and the spermatocele was identified.  All the layers of the spermatocele were removed.  Clear layer was visualized, was taken all the way up to the base, the base was tied.  Entire spermatocele sac was removed.  After removing the entire spermatocele sac, hemostasis was obtained.  The testicle was not in normal orientation.  The testis and epididymis was removed, which is a small appendage on the superior aspect of the testicle.  The testicle was placed in a normal orientation.  Careful attention was drawn not to twist the cord.  Orchidopexy was done to allow the testes to stay stable in the postoperative period using 4-0 Vicryl and was tied at 3 different locations.  Absorbable sutures were used, so that the patient does not feel the sutures in the postoperative period.  The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in running locking fashion.  There was excellent hemostasis.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Superior scrotal incisions were then made with 15-blade knife and further extended up to the subcutaneous tissue and dartos fascia with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The subdartos pouch was created with curved tenotomy scissors.  The tunica vaginalis was then delivered, incised, and testis was delivered.  The testis itself with a bell-clapper deformity.  There was no actual torsion at the present time, there was some modest congestion and, however, the vasculature was markedly congested down the cord.  The penis fascia was cauterized and subdartos pouch was created.  The upper aspect of fascia was then closed with pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in a proper orientation.  No tacking sutures within the testis itself were used.  The tunica vaginalis; however, was wrapped perfectly behind the back of the testis.  A similar procedure was performed on the right side.  Again, an appendix testis was cauterized.  No torsion was seen.  He also had a bell-clapper deformity and similar dartos pouch was created and the testis was placed in the scrotum in the proper orientation and the upper aspect closed with #4-0 chromic suture.  The local anesthetic was then used for both as cord block, as well as a local wound insufflation bilaterally with 0.25% Marcaine.  The scrotal wall was then closed with subcuticular closure of #4-0 chromic.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was then used.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was given IV Toradol and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","urology, de-torsed bilateral testes, testes fixation, bell clapper deformity, testicular torsion, subdartos pouch, tunica vaginalis, scrotal exploration, appendix testes, scrotal, testes, torsion, detorsion, insufflation, testis, "

It was subsequently obstructed with multiple episodes of pyelonephritis, two percutaneous tube placements, ureteroscopy with balloon dilation of the system, and continued obstruction.  Plan is for co surgeons due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstruction.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operative room.  Surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Dr. X and Dr. Y both agreed upon the procedures in advance.  Dr. Y then, once the patient was anesthetized, requested IV antibiotics with Fortaz, the patient had a caudal block placed, and he was then placed in lithotomy position.  Dr. Y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8, 10, and up to 12 French.  The 9.5-French cystoscope sheath was then placed within the patient's bladder with the offset scope, and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis.  I was able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally, although no urine coming from the right.  We then placed a 4-French ureteral catheter into the ureter as far as we could go.  An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed, which shows that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis, but did not go into the ureter.  A retrograde was performed, and it was found that there was a narrowed band across the two.  Upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity, the pelvis which had been clamped and its nephrostomy tube did not drain at all.  Dr. Y then placed a 0.035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4-French catheter and then placed a 4.7-French double-J catheter into the ureter as far as it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder.  Once this was completed, we then removed the cystoscope and sheath, placed a 10-French Foley catheter, and the patient was positioned by Dr. X and Dr. Y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arms and legs as well as a brachial plexus roll.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  Dr. Y then incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised.  Once this was then dissected, Dr. Y and Dr. X divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  At this point, Dr. X used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  The tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  Ultimately, Dr. Y and Dr. X both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where Dr. Y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  Dr. Y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 Monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  Dr. X then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by Dr. Y and Dr. X closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  Once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  This opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  Electrocautery was used on the base.  There was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  Dermabond and Gelfoam were placed, and then Dr. Y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-Gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  Dr. X then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl in 3 layers.  Dr. Y closed the Scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Rapide respectively.  A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a Foley catheter placed in the bladder.  The Foley catheter was then taped to his leg.  A second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.","urology, cystoscopy, pyeloureteroscopy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, pseudomonas pyelonephritis, renal insufficiency, fortaz, ureteropelvic junction repair, nephrostomy tube, renal biopsy, renal pelvis, foley catheter, ureteropelvic junction, renal, ureteropelvic,"

My camera ports were then placed in the standard fan array.  A camera port was placed in the midline above the umbilicus using the Hasson technique.  The balloon port was placed, the abdomen insufflated, and all other ports were placed under direct vision.  My assistant was on the right.  The patient was then placed in the steep Trendelenburg position, and the robot brought forward and appropriately docked.,I then proceeded to drop the bladder into the peritoneal cavity by incising between the right and left medial umbilical ligaments and carrying that dissection laterally along these ligaments deep into the pelvis.  This nicely exposed the space of Retzius.  I then defatted the anterior surface of the prostate and endopelvic fascia.,The endopelvic fascia was then opened bilaterally.  The levator ani muscles were carefully dissected free from the prostate and pushed laterally.  Dissection was continued posteriorly toward the bundles and caudally to the apex.  The puboprostatic ligaments were then transected.  A secure ligature of 0 Vicryl was placed around the dorsal venous complex.,I then approached the bladder neck.  The anterior bladder neck was transected down to the level of the Foley catheter, which was lifted anteriorly in the wound.  I then transected the posterior bladder neck down to the level of the ampullae of the vas.  The ampullae were mobilized and transected.  These were lifted anteriorly in the field, exposing the seminal vesicles, which were similarly mobilized.  Hemostasis was obtained using the bipolar Bovie.,I then identified the Denonvilliers fascia, and this was incised sharply.  Dissection was continued caudally along the anterior surface of the rectum and laterally toward the bundles.  I was able to then identify the pedicles over the seminal vesicles, which were hemoclipped and transected.,The field was then copiously irrigated with sterile water.  Hemostasis was found to be complete.  I then carried out a urethrovesical anastomosis.  This was accomplished with 3-0 Monocryl ligatures.  Two of these were tied together in the midline.  They were placed at the 6 o'clock position, and one was run in a clockwise and the other in a counterclockwise direction to the 12 o'clock position where they were securely tied.  A new Foley catheter was then easily delivered into the bladder and irrigated without extravasation.  The patient was given indigo carmine, and there was prompt blue urine in the Foley., ,I then carried out a bladder suspension.  This was done in hopes of obtaining early urinary control.  This was accomplished with 0 Vicryl ligatures.  One was placed at the bladder neck and through the dorsal venous complex and then the other along the anterior surface of the bladder to the posterior surface of the pubis.  This nicely re-retroperitonealized the bladder.,The prostate was then placed in an Endocatch bag and brought out through an extended camera port incision.  A JP drain was brought in through the 4th arm port and sutured to the skin with 2-0 silk.  The camera port fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl.  The skin incisions were closed with a running, subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  There were no complications.  Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case.","urology, adenocarcinoma, prostate, radical retropubic prostatectomy, robotic assisted, bladder, uspension, bladder neck, intubation, robotic, retropubic, prostatectomy"

Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Deep venous thrombosis.,6.  Recurrence of the cancer.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area.  Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered.  The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed.  The rectus fascia was opened sharply.  The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly.  Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed.  The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched.  The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder.  Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips.  The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section.  The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors.  The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply.  The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area.  The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle.  The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra was then identified and was dissected out.  The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly.  2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later.  The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected.  The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides.  The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply.  No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time.  The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily.  Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely.  The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected.  The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles.  Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen.  The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact.  It was sent for permanent section.  The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels.  The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck.  Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck.  A 20-French Foley Catheter was used.  The anterior sutures were then placed.  The Foley was then inflated.  The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly.  Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight.  Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces.  These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed.  The fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  Skin was approximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.","urology, prostate cancer, foley catheter, metzenbaum scissors, prostate, adenocarcinoma, bladder, lymphadenectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, perivesical, prostatectomy, retropubic, urethra, radical retropubic prostatectomy, lymph node dissection, dorsal vein complex, radical retropubic, lymph node, dorsal vein, vein complex, bladder neck, sutures, foley, urethral,"

Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Injury to the adjacent viscera.,6.  Deep venous thrombosis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty.  The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie.  Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  A Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors.  Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie.  Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra could then be easily identified.  Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This exposed the blue Foley catheter.  Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture.  Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  The Foley catheter was then removed.  This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  This was developed without any difficulty.  Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  The tip was left behind.  Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  This was performed on the left side and then the right side.  This completely freed the prostate.  The prostate was sent for permanent section.  The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  This was performed by using a French ***** needle.  A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.","urology, prostate cancer, foley catheter, gleason, psa, prostate, adenocarcinoma, bladder neck, core biopsy, figure-of-eight, lymph node dissection, nerve-sparing, prostatectomy, rectus fascia, retropubic, bladder neck dissection, dorsal vein complex, nerve sparing, perirectal fat, seminal vesicles, sutures, bladder, urethra, posteriorly, seminal, vesicles, fascia, neck, dissection,"

Kidney stones.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries.  Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  Sequential compression devices were also placed.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas.  Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  There was no obvious urine extravasation.  At this time, the procedure was terminated.  The robot was undocked.  Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.","urology, pyeloplasty, ureteral stent placement, nephrolithotomy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, jackson-pratt drain, foley catheter, renal pelvis, kidney stones, monocryl sutures, pelvis, renal, ureteropelvic, sutures, "

There was noted to be some tightness of the urethra on passage.  On visualization of the bladder, there were no stones or any other debris within the bladder.  There were no abnormalities seen.  No masses, diverticuli, or other abnormal findings.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and attempts to pass to a cone tip catheter, however, the ureteral orifice was noted to be also tight and we were unable to pass the cone tip catheter.  The cone tip catheter was removed and a glidewire was then passed without difficulty up into the renal pelvis.  An open-end ureteral catheter was then passed ________ into the distal right ureter.  Retrograde pyelogram was then performed.,There was noted to be an UPJ calculus with no noted hydronephrosis.  The wire was then passed back through the ureteral catheter.  The catheter was removed and a 22 x 4.5 mm double-J ureteral stent was then passed over the glidewire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance.  The stent was clear within the kidney as well as within the bladder.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She will be discharged home.

His previous PSAs were in the 1 range.  TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden.  After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy.  Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision.  The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room here.  Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area.  The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes.  The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field.  Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision.  A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus.  Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle.  Space of rectus sheath was then entered.  The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area.  The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected.  This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein.  Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall.  The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally.  Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves.  An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated.  The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation.  The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad.  The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia.  The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments.  Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders.  A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle.  A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis.  Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide.  Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter.  The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra.  The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end.  The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end.  The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety.  A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex.  The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut.  Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue.  Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal.  Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete.  Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia.  The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip.  Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters.  The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate.  Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity.  Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation.  The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion.  The rest of the mucosa was then everted.  The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure.  At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position.  Hemostasis was then adequately obtained.  FloSeal was applied to the pelvis.  The bladder was then irrigated.  It was draining pink urine.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS.  The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications.  The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU.  Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted.  This was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation.","urology, bilateral lymph node dissection, retropubic prostatectomy, radical retropubic prostatectomy, gleason score, prostate cancer, trus, biopsy, bilateral lymph node, lymph node dissection, catheter was inserted, bilateral lymph, node dissection, vicryl stitch, prostatic pedicles, pelvic veins, external iliac, iliac vein, seminal vesicle, lymph node, foley catheter, dorsal venous, venous complex, bladder neck, dissection, prostatectomy, bladder, endopelvic, vicryl, catheter, vein, venous, fascia, dorsal, urethra, "

General endotracheal intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum, scrotum, penis, and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15-minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra.  The bladder was subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter.  At that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space.  Care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture.  At that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies.  Attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant.  This was dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis.  At this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis.  As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery.  At that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum.  This was brought up into _________ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two #3-0 Prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body.  The corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty.  However, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures.  This was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body.  The left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted.  After removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen.  Both corporal bodies were then dilated with the Pratt dilators.  These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces.  At this point, using the Farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally.  He had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed.  We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis.  Confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest.  We felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm.  At this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty.  Attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders.  This then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis.  There was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea.  The rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 PDS in a running fashion.  ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants.  At that point, the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times.  There was a very good fit and we had a very good result.  At that point, the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  This was held in place with a Babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump.  Please also note that before placement of our pump, attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device, which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty.  The entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated.  After completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be ________ with good cosmetic result.  At that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic.  The soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers.  The soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples.  Please also note that prior to the skin closure, a Jackson-Pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours.  This was also sutured in place with nylon.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Light gauze was wrapped around the penis and/or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally.  Coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine.  No Foley catheter was used or placed.,The patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.

He is otherwise healthy.  He tried to insert a marble in his penis four days ago.  He told me that he grabbed the skin on the top of the penis and moved it away from the penis shaft and then using a toothbrush that he made in to a knife object he pierced the skin through from both sides and then kept moving the toothbrush to dilate and make a way for the marble.  Then he inserted a heart-shaped marble in one of the puncture wounds and inserted it under the skin and kept it there.  He was not significantly bleeding and essentially the bleeding stopped from both puncture wounds that he has.  Then today four days after that procedure, he was taking a bath today and he thinks because of the weight he felt a gush in his pants and he looked and he saw the bleeding come out.  He was bleeding so much that he started dripping to the sides of his legs.  So, he was brought to the hospital.  Actually after being seen by two nurses at the facility where he was at the detention center where he was at and they actually did the dressing twice and it was twice soaked with blood.  He came here and was continuously bleeding from that area that we had to change the dressing twice and he is actually still bleeding especially from one of the laceration, the one on the right side of the penis.  The marble also still can be felt underneath the skin.  There is no urethral bleeding.  He did urinate today without difficulty, without hematuria or dysuria.  There is pain in the lacerations.

The child initially had a newborn circumcision at about 1 week of life and then developed a concealed or buried penis with extra skin and tightness of the skin.  He underwent a second circumcision with a general anesthetic approximately 8 to 9 days ago.  The mother states that on Thursday, he developed fairly significant swelling, scrotum was also swollen, the suprapubic region was swollen, and he was having a purulent discharge and a fairly significant fever to 102 to 103.  He was seen at Hospital, transferred to Children's Hospital for further care.  Since being hospitalized, his cultures apparently have grown Staph but is unknown yet whether it is methicillin-resistant.

There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection.  He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans.  The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time.  The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness.  Both testes were descended without hydroceles.,EXTREMITIES:  He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities.,SKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.,BACK:  Normal.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis.  This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities.  I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad.  I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day.  I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely.  Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so.  He has a scheduled followup appointment with his urologist  and he should keep that appointment or followup sooner if there is any other problem arising.","urology, newborn circumcision, suprapubic fat pad, penile cellulitis, penile swelling, cellulitis, penis, penile, suprapubic, circumcision, "

I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic.  He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ,When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side.  His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration.  They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially.  I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels.  I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation.  If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. ,Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic.

Right orchiopexy.,2.  Right herniorrhaphy.,ANESTHESIA: , LMA.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , Sac.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 10-year-old male who presented to us with his mom with consultation from Craig Connor at Cottonwood with right undescended testis.  The patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding.  The testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring.  The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac.  The patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown.  Options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, HCG stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed.  The patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in supine position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area.  After the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal.  The incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified.  The external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring.  The ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture.  After dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal.  The testis was pulled up.  The cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried all the way up to the internal inguinal ring.  There was very small hernia, which was removed and was tied at the base.  PDS suture was used to tie this hernia sac all the way up to the base.  There was a Y right at the vas and cord indicating there was enough length into the scrotal sac.  The testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac.  One centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a Dartos pouch was created.  The testicle was brought down into the pouch and was placed into the pouch.  Careful attention was done to ensure that there was no torsion of the cord.  The vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout.  The epididymis was in the posterolateral location.  The testicle was pexed using 4-0 Vicryl into the scrotal sac.  Skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl.  The external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 PDS.  Attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring.  A small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord.  Marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 mL worth of this was applied for local anesthesia.  After closing the external oblique fascia, the Scarpa was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dermabond and Steri-Strips were applied.,The patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.,Please note that the testicle was viable.  It was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%.  There were no palpable testicular masses.  Plan was for the patient to follow up with us in about 1 month.  The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting for at least 3 months, okay to shower in 48 hours.  No tub bath for 2 months.  The patient and family understood all the instructions.","urology, undescended testicle, orchiopexy & herniorrhaphy, external oblique fascia, inguinal ring, scrotal sac, oblique fascia, testicle, herniorrhaphy, orchiopexy, inguinal"

The plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped.  A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue.  We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring.  We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered.  We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia.  The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal.  We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors.  Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture.  We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length.  We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off.  We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum.  The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch.  The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then placed the local anesthetic, and the ilioinguinal nerve block, and placed a small amount in both incisional areas as well.  We then closed the external oblique fascia with a running suture of 0-Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure.  The Scarpa fascia was closed with a 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.

Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  He was then placed in the supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  Since the testis was in the ectopic position, we did an upper curvilinear scrotal incision with a 15-blade knife and further extended it with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was also used for hemostasis.  A subdartos pouch was then created with a curved tenotomy scissors.  The tunica vaginalis was grasped with a curved mosquito clamp and then dissected from its gubernacular attachments.  As we were dissecting it, we then found the testis itself into the sac, and we opened the sac, and it was found to be slightly atrophic about 12 mm in length and had a type III epididymal attachment, not being attached to the top.  We then dissected the hernia sac off of the testis __________ some traction using the straight Joseph scissors and straight and curved mosquito clamps.  Once this was dissected off, we then twisted it upon itself, and then dissected it down towards the external ring, but on traction.  We then twisted it upon itself, suture ligated it with 3-0 Vicryl and released it, allowing it to spring back into the canal.  Once this was done, we then had adequate length of the testis into the scrotal sac.  Using a curved mosquito clamp, we grasped the base of the scrotum internally, and using the subcutaneous tissue, we tacked it to the base of the testis using a 4-0 chromic suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  The upper aspect of the pouch was closed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic.  The scrotal skin and dartos were then closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic, and Dermabond tissue adhesive was used on the incision.  IV Toradol was given.  Both testes were well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.","urology, ectopic position, inguinal hernia, inguinal hernia repair, hernia sac, tunica vaginalis, gubernacular attachments, testis ectopic position, curved mosquito clamp, caudal block, hernia repair, undescended testis, orchiopexy, dissected, hernia, inguinal, testis,"

Ultrasound showed metastasis to be high in the left inguinal canal.  The right testis is located in the right inguinal canal on ultrasound and apparently ultrasound could not be displaced into the right hemiscrotum.  Both testes appeared to be normal in size for the boy's age.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , As above, both testes appeared viable and normal in size, no masses.  There is a hernia on the left side.  The spermatic cord was quite short on the left and required Prentiss Maneuver to achieve adequate length for scrotal placement.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The boy was taken to the operating room, where he was placed on the operating table.  General anesthesia was administered by Dr. X, after which the boy's lower abdomen and genitalia were prepared with Betadine and draped aseptically.  A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated subcutaneously in the skin crease in the left groin in the area of the intended incision.  An inguinal incision was then made through this area, carried through the subcutaneous tissues to the anterior fascia.  External ring was exposed with dissection as well.  The fascia was opened in direction of its fibers exposing the testes, which lay high in the canal.  The testes were freed with dissection by removing cremasteric and spermatic fascia.  The hernia sac was separated from the cord, twisted and suture ligated at the internal ring.  Lateral investing bands of the spermatic cords were divided high into the inguinal internal ring.  However, this would only allow placement of the testes in the upper scrotum with some tension.,Therefore, the left inguinal canal was incised and the inferior epigastric artery and vein were ligated with #4-0 Vicryl and divided.  This maneuver allowed for placement of the testes in the upper scrotum without tension.,A sub dartos pouch was created by separating the abdominal fascia from the scrotal skin after making an incision in the left hemiscrotum in the direction of the vessel.  The testes were then brought into the pouch and anchored with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was approximated with interrupted #5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  Inspection of the spermatic cord in the inguinal area revealed no twisting and the testicular cover was good.  Internal oblique muscle was approximated to the shelving edge and Poupart ligament with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl over the spermatic cord and the external oblique fascia was closed with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  Additional 7 mL of Marcaine was infiltrated subfascially and the skin was closed with running #5-0 subcuticular after placing several #4-0 Vicryl approximating sutures in the subcutaneous tissues.,Attention was then turned to the opposite side, where an orchiopexy was performed in a similar fashion.  However, on this side, there was no inguinal hernia.  The testes were located in a superficial pouch of the inguinal canal and there was adequate length on the spermatic cord, so that the Prentiss maneuver was not required on this side.  The sub dartos pouch was created in a similar fashion and the wounds were closed similarly as well.,The inguinal and scrotal incisions were cleansed after completion of the procedure.  Steri-Strips and Tegaderm were applied to the inguinal incisions and collodion to the scrotal incision.  The child was then awakened and transported to post-anesthetic recovery area apparently in satisfactory condition.  Instrument and sponge counts were correct.  There were no apparent complications.  Estimated blood loss was less than 20 to 30 mL.","urology, bilateral orchiopexy, bilateral undescended testes, prentiss maneuver, subcutaneous tissues, internal ring, dartos pouch, scrotal incisions, undescended testes, spermatic cord, inguinal canal, testes, inguinally, orchiopexy, undescended, cord, vicryl, ultrasound, spermatic, canal,"

Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  The patient was placed in supine position and examined.  The left testis well within scrotum.  The right was again not palpable despite the patient being asleep with multiple attempts to check.,The patient was then sterilely prepped and draped.  An 8-French feeding tube was then placed within his bladder through the urethra and attached to the drainage.  We then incised the infraumbilical area once he was sterilely prepped and draped, with 15 blade knife, then using Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl.  We entered the peritoneum with the 5-mm one-step system.  We then used the short 0-degree lens for laparoscopy.  We then insufflated with carbon dioxide insufflation to pressure of 12 mmHg.  There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found.  Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures.  Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide.  A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac.  The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring.  There was no apparent testicular tissue.  We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent.  We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic.  We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation.  Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum.  At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.

The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring.  This incision was about 1.5 cm in length.  The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique.  This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia.  The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free.  A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located.  Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring.  This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially.  The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity.  Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels.  Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.  The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high.  This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum.  The testicle was viable.  This was wrapped in a moist sponge.,Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum.  A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall.  Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.  A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection.  The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided.  The hemostat was then passed through the incision.  A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal.  The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision.  The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle.  The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture.  Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed.  Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly.  This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.  The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture.  The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch.  Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied.

The patient was placed in prone position.  A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up.  The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues.  The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen.  Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed.  The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature.  The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area.  The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation.  There was no sensation down the leg.  The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle.  A wire was placed.  The tract was dilated and lead was placed.  The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position.  Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation.  Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks.  Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling.  A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead.  Screws were turned and they were dropped.  Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim.  Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch.  Impedance was checked.

He accepts the risks to include bleeding requiring transfusion, infection, sepsis, incontinence, impotence, bladder neck constricture, heart attack, stroke, pulmonary emboli, phlebitis, injury to the bladder, rectum, or ureter, etcetera.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the Operating Room and placed in the supine position, prepped with Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 20- French Foley catheter was inserted into the penis and into the bladder and placed to dependent drainage.  The table was then placed in minimal flexed position.  A midline skin incision was then made from the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis.  It was carried down to the anterior rectus fascia into the pelvis proper.  Both obturator fossae were exposed.  Standard bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections were carried out.  The left side was approached first by myself.  The limits of my dissection were from the external iliac vein laterally to the obturator nerve medially, and from the bifurcation of the common iliac vein proximally to Cooper's ligament distally.  Meticulous lymphostasis and hemostasis was obtained using hemoclips and 2-0 silk ligatures.  The obturator nerve was visualized throughout and was not injured.  The right side was carried out by my assistant under my direct and constant supervision.  Again, the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and it was not injured.  Both packets were sent to Pathology where no evidence of carcinoma was found.,My attention was then directed to the prostate itself.  The  endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  Using gentle dissection with a Kitner, I swept the levator muscles off the prostate and exposed the apical portion of the prostate.  A back bleeding control suture of 0 Vicryl was placed at the mid-prostate level.  A sternal wire was then placed behind the dorsal vein complex which was sharply transected.  The proximal and distal portions of this complex were then oversewn with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, my attention was then turned to the neurovascular bundles.,The urethra was then sharply transected and six sutures of 2-0 Monocryl placed at the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock positions.  The prostate was then lifted retrograde in the field and was swept from the anterior surface of the rectum and the posterior layer of Denonvilliers' fascia was incised distally, swept off the rectum and incorporated with the prostate specimen.  The lateral pedicles over the seminal vesicles were then mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles themselves were then mobilized and hemostasis obtained using hemoclips.  Ampullae of the vas were mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The bladder neck was then developed using careful blunt and sharp dissection.  The prostate was then transected at the level of the bladder neck and sent for permanent specimen.  The bladder neck was reevaluated and the ureteral orifices were found to be placed well back from the edge.  The bladder neck was reconstructed in standard fashion.  It was closed using a running 2-0 Vicryl.  The mucosa was everted over the edge of the bladder neck using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture.  At the end of this portion of the case, the new bladder neck had a stoma-like appearance and would accommodate easily my small finger.  The field was then re-evaluated for hemostasis which was further obtained using hemoclips, Bovie apparatus and 3-0 chromic ligatures.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, the aforementioned Monocryl sutures were then placed at the corresponding positions in the bladder neck.  A new 20-French Foley catheter was brought in through the urethra into the bladder.  A safety suture of 0 Prolene was brought through the end of this and out through a separate stab wound in the bladder and through the left lateral quadrant.  The table was taken out of flexion and the bladder was then brought into approximation to the urethra and the Monocryl sutures were ligated.  The bladder was then copiously irrigated with sterile water and the anastomosis was found to be watertight.  The pelvis was also copiously irrigated with 2 liters of sterile water.  A 10-French Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the pelvis and brought out through the right lower quadrant and sutured in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The muscle was closed with a running 0 chromic, the fascia with a running 1-0 Vicryl, the subcutaneous tissue with 3-0 plain, and the skin with a running 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular.  Steri-Strips were applied and a sterile dressing.,The patient was taken to the Recovery Room in good condition.  There were no complications.

The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain.  Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle.  Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed.  Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis.  The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed.  The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made.  There was very, very thick scrotal skin.  There was no necrotic skin.  As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum.  The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus.  The pus just poured out of the left testicle.  The left testicle was completely removed.  Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue.  Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum.  There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement.  A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum.  I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal.  So, the right hemiscrotum was opened.  The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick.  The testicle appeared normal.  There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum.  At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion.  The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress.  There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy.  Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run.  The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition.","urology, testicular abscess, necrotic testes, orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, orchidopexy, hemiscrotum, testicular torsion, penrose drain, scrotal swelling, scrotal wall, testicle, torsion"

The patient did receive Ancef.,INDICATIONS AND CONSENT: , This is a 16-year-old African-American male who had an ectopic left testis that severed approximately one-and-a-half years ago.  The patient did have an MRI, which confirmed ectopic testis located near the pubic tubercle.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient.  Informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient did receive Ancef antibiotics prior to the procedure.  He was then wheeled to the operative suite where a general anesthetic was administered.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and shaved in the area of the intended procedure.  Next, with a #15 blade scalpel, an oblique skin incision was made over the spermatic cord region.  The fascia was then dissected down both bluntly and sharply and hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  The fascia of the external oblique, creating the external ring was then encountered and that was grasped in two areas with hemostats and sized with Metzenbaum scissors.  This was then continued to open the external ring and was then carried cephalad to further open the external ring, exposing the spermatic cord.  With this accomplished, the testis was then identified.  It was located over the left pubic tubercle region and soft tissue was then meticulously dissected and cared to avoid all vascular and testicular structures.,The cord length was then achieved by applying some tension to the testis and further dissecting any of the fascial adhesions along the spermatic cord.  Once again, meticulous care was maintained not to involve any neurovascular or contents of the testis or vas deferens.  Weitlaner retractor was placed to provide further exposure.  There was a small vein encountered posterior to the testis and this was then hemostated into place and cut with Metzenbaum scissors and doubly ligated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Again hemostasis was maintained with ligation and Bovie electrocautery with adequate mobilization of the spermatic cord and testis.  Next, bluntly a tunnel was created through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment.  This was taken down to approximately the two-thirds length of the left scrotal compartment.  Once this tunnel has been created, a #15 blade scalpel was then used to make transverse incision.  A skin incision through the scrotal skin and once again the skin edges were grasped with Allis forceps and the dartos was then entered with the Bovie electrocautery exposing the scrotal compartment.  Once this was achieved, the apices of the dartos were then grasped with hemostats and supra-dartos pouch was then created using the Iris scissors.  A dartos pouch was created between the skin and the supra-dartos, both cephalad and caudad to the level of the scrotal incision.  A hemostat was then placed from inferior to superior through the created tunnel and the testis was pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch ensuring that anatomic position was in place, maintaining the epididymis posterolateral without any rotation of the cord.  With this accomplished, #3-0 Prolene was then used to tack both the medial and lateral aspects of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis.  The sutures were then tied creating the orchiopexy.  The remaining body of the testicle was then tucked into the supra-dartos pouch and the skin was then approximated with #4-0 undyed Monocryl in a horizontal mattress fashion interrupted sutures.  Once again hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  Finally the attention was made towards the inguinal incision and this was then copiously irrigated and any remaining bleeders were then fulgurated with Bovie electrocautery to make sure to avoid any neurovascular spermatic structures.  External ring was then recreated and grasped on each side with hemostats and approximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion cephalad to caudad.  Once this was created, the created ring was inspected and there was adequate room for the cord.  There appeared to be no evidence of compression.  Finally, subcutaneous layer with sutures of #4-0 interrupted chromic was placed and then the skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient had been injected with bupivacaine prior to closing the skin.  Finally, the patient was cleansed.,The scrotal support was placed and plan will the for the patient to take Keflex one tablet q.i.d. x7 days as well as Tylenol #3 for severe pain and Motrin for moderate pain as well as applying ice packs to scrotum.

The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes.  Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.  The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.","urology, laparoscopic right orchiopexy, undescended testes, orchiopexy, bilateral undescended testes, mosquito clamps, subdartos pouch, internal ring, laparoscopic,"

The penis was inspected.  The meatus was inspected and an incision was made in the dorsal portion of the meatus up towards the tip of the penis connecting this with the ventral urethral groove.  This was incised longitudinally and closed transversely with 5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The meatus was calibrated and accepted the calibrating instrument without difficulty, and there was no stenosis.  An incision was made transversely below the meatus in a circumferential way around the shaft of the penis, bringing up the skin of the penis from the corpora.  The glans was undermined with sharp dissection and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  Using a skin hook, the meatus was elevated ventrally and the glans flaps were reapproximated using 5-0 chromic catgut, creating a new ventral portion of the glans using the flaps of skin.  There was good viability of the skin.  The incision around the base of the penis was performed, separating the foreskin that was going to be removed from the coronal skin.

The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion after building up the right side of the OR table to aid in the patient's positioning for bowel retraction.  Hassan technique was performed for the initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region.  Abdominal insufflation was performed.  There were significant adhesions noted.  A second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a Harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially.  The kidney was able to be palpated within Gerota's fascia.  The psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  The uterus was grasped with a Babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  The renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  There was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  We were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed.  The renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  Fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and Bovie cautery.  The tissue was sent down to Pathology for analysis.  Please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  Ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  The renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  At this point, the indwelling double-J ureteral stent was removed.  At this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 Vicryl suture was placed.  This was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  The back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, a double-J stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder.  The anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running Vicryl suture.  Renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place.  Please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue.  This was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 Vicryl.  FloSeal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this.  A good hemostasis was noted.  A #10 Blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis.  The initial trocar incision was closed with #0 Vicryl suture.  The abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 Vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin edges were then closed with staples.  Please note that all port sites were inspected prior to closing and hemostasis was noted at all sites and the fascia was noted to be reapproximated as these trocar sites were placed with the ________ obturator.

The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated.  The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors.  Care was taken not to injure the ilioinguinal nerve.  Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed.  Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery.,The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures.  The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery.,Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature.  The sac was excised and sent to Pathology.  The stump was examined and no bleeding was noted.  The ends of the suture were then cut, and the stump retracted back into the abdomen.,The floor of the inguinal canal was then strengthened by suturing the shelving edge of Poupart's ligament to the conjoined tendon using a 2-0 Prolene, starting at the pubic tubercle and running towards the internal ring.

The procedure was discussed with the patient and the patient opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at the open inguinal repair on the right.  The patient also is requesting circumcision with phimosis at the same operating time setting.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced.  The patient was also found to have a phimosis, which was easily removed.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to operating suite, after general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel.  The umbilical skin was elevated with a towel clip and the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Saline drop test proved entrance into the abdominal cavity and then the abdomen was insufflated to sufficient pressure of 15 mmHg.  Next, the Veress was removed and #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted and the abdomen was explored.  There was evidence of a large right inguinal hernia, which had omentum as well as bowel within it, easily reducible.  Attention was next made to placing a #12 port in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus.  Again, a skin was made with a #15 blade scalpel and the #12 port was inserted under direct visualization.  A #5 port was inserted in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization.  Next, a grasper with blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac and using an Endoshears, the peritoneum was scored towards the midline and towards the medial umbilical ligament and lateral.  The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, opening up and identifying the iliopubic tract, which was identified without difficulty.  Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum.  This was done without difficulty reducing the hernia in its entirety.  Attention was next made to placing a piece of Prolene mesh, it was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract.  The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum and then the patient was re-peritonealized, re-approximating edge of the perineum with the 4.8 mm staples.  This was done without difficulty.  All three ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding and the #10 and #12 mm ports were closed with #0-Vicryl and UR6 needle.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  Attention was next made to carrying out the circumcision.  The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head.  The desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker.  The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head.  A #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as specimen.  This was done without difficulty.  Next, the remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially.  This was done without difficulty maintaining hemostasis.,A petroleum jelly was applied with a Coban dressing.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was well and was transferred to recovery after extubation in stable condition.","urology, herniorrhaphy with mesh, laparoscopic, blunt dissector, inguinal herniorrhaphy, inguinal hernia, hernia, inguinal, peritoneum, circumcision, phimosis, foreskin"

The patient was started on alpha-blockers with some help, but had nocturia q.1h.  The patient was given anticholinergics with minimal to no help.  The patient had a cystoscopy done, which showed enlargement of the left lateral lobes of the prostate.  At this point, options were discussed such as watchful waiting and laser vaporization to open up the prostate to get a better stream.  Continuation of alpha-blockers and adding another anti-cholinergic at night to prevent bladder overactivity were discussed.  The patient was told that his symptoms may be related to the mild-to-moderate trabeculation in the bladder, which can cause poor compliance.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with laser vaporization to see if it would help improve his stream, which in turn might help improve emptying of the bladder and might help his overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was told that he may need anticholinergics.  There could be increased risk of incontinence, stricture, erectile dysfunction, other complications and the consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given preoperative antibiotics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #23-French scope was inserted inside the urethra into the bladder under direct vision.  Bilateral pyelograms were normal.  The rest of the bladder appeared normal except for some moderate trabeculations throughout the bladder.  There was enlargement of the lateral lobes of the prostate.  The old TUR scar was visualized right at the bladder neck.  Using diode side-firing fiber, the lateral lobes were taken down.  The verumontanum, the external sphincter, and the ureteral openings were all intact at the end of the procedure.  Pictures were taken and were shown to the family.  At the end of the procedure, there was good hemostasis.  A total of about 15 to 20 minutes of lasering time was used.  A #22 3-way catheter was placed.  At the end of the procedure, the patient was brought to recovery in stable condition.  Plan was for removal of the Foley catheter in 48 hours and continuation of use of anticholinergics at night.","urology, laser vaporization of the prostate, cystopyelogram, benign prostatic hypertroph, benign prostatic hypertrophy, alpha blockers, laser vaporization, anticholinergics, laser, vaporization, prostate, bladder"

Hypertension.,CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: , Stable.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , None.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 44-year-old African-American male who was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis three times per week approximately four to five months ago.  He reports that over the past month, he has been feeling lightheaded when standing and has had three syncopal episodes during this time with return of consciousness after several minutes.  He reportedly had this even while seated and denied overt dizziness.  He reports this lightheadedness is made even worse when standing.  He has had these symptoms almost daily over the past month.  He does report some confusion when he awakens.  He reports that he loses consciousness for two to three minutes.  Denies any bowel or bladder loss, although he reports very little urine output secondary to his end-stage renal disease.  He denied any palpitations, warmth, or diaphoresis, which is indicative of vasovagal syncope.  There were no witnesses to his syncopal episodes.  He also denied any clonic activity and no history of seizures.  In the emergency room, the patient was given fluids and orthostatics were checked.  At that time, orthostatics were negative; however, due to the fact that fluid had been given before, it is impossible to rule out orthostatic hypotension.  The patient presented to the hospital on Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d. and lisinopril 10 mg daily secondary to his hypertension, congestive heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage renal disease.  Regarding his syncopal episodes, he was admitted with likely orthostatic hypotension.  Cardiology was consulted and their recommendations were to reduce the lisinopril to 5 mg daily.  At that time, the Coreg had been held secondary to hypotension.  Cardiology also ordered a nuclear medicine myocardial perfusion stress test.  Regarding the end-stage renal disease, Nephrology was consulted as the patient was due for hemodialysis treatment the day following admission.  Nephrology was able to perform dialysis on the patient and Renal concurred that the presyncopal symptoms were likely due to decreased intravascular volume in the postdialytic time frame.  Renal agreed with decreasing his lisinopril to 5 mg daily and decreasing the Coreg to 6.25 mg b.i.d.  They reported that the Procrit should be continued.  As previously indicated regarding the dilated cardiomyopathy, Cardiology ordered a nuclear medicine stress test to be performed.  Also, regarding the patient's hypertension, he actually was noted to have hypotension on admission, and as previously stated, the Coreg was originally discontinued and then it was restarted at 6.25 mg b.i.d. and the patient tolerated this well.  The patient's hospital course remained uncomplicated until September 17, 2007, the day the nuclear medicine stress test was scheduled.  The patient stated that he was reluctant to proceed with the test and he was afraid of needles and the risks associated with the test although the procedure was explained to the patient and the risks of the procedure were quit low, the patient proceeded to discharge himself against medical advice.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS:,The patient left AMA.

3885, The patient was referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy to improve her functional communication skills and swallowing function and safety., Discharge Summary, Speech Therapy - Discharge Summary - 1 ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 67-year-old female, was referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy to improve her functional communication skills and swallowing function and safety.  At the onset of therapy, on 03/26/08, the patient was NPO with a G-tube and the initial speech and language evaluation revealed global aphasia with an aphasia quotient of 3.6/100 based on the Western Aphasia Battery.  Since the initial evaluation, the patient has attended 60 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which have focussed on her receptive communication, expressive language, multimodality communication skills, and swallowing function and safety.,SHORT-TERM GOALS:,1.  The patient met 3 out of 4 original short-term therapy goals, which were to complete a modified barium swallow study, which she did do and which revealed no aspiration.  At this time, the patient is eating and drinking and taking all medications by mouth; however, her G-tube is still present.  The patient was instructed to talk to the primary care physician about removal of her feeding tube.,2.  The patient will increase accuracy of yes-no responses to greater than 80% accuracy.  She did accomplish this goal.  The patient is also able to identify named objects with greater than 80% accuracy.,ADDITIONAL GOALS: , Following the completion of these goals, additional goals were established.  Based on reevaluation, the patient met 2 out of these 3 initial goals and she is currently able to read and understand simple sentences with greater than 90% accuracy independently and she is able to write 10 words related to basic wants and needs with greater than 80% accuracy independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty stating verbally, yes or no, to questions as well as accurately using head gestures and to respond to yes-no questions.  The patient continues to have marked difficulty with her expressive language abilities.  She is able to write simple words to help express her basic wants and needs.  She has made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read words as well as short phrases and able to point to named objects and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions.  A reevaluation completed on 12/01/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4.  Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech.  An alternative communication device was discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient does not want to utilize a communication device.  If, in the future, the patient continues to struggle with her expressive communication, an alternative augmented communication device would be a benefit to her.  Please reconsult at that time if and when the patient is ready to use a speech generating device.  The patient is discharged from my services at this time due to a plateau in her progress.  Numerous home activities were recommended to allow her to continue to make progress at home.","discharge summary, communication skills, g-tube, aphasia, language evaluation, western aphasia battery, skilled speech therapy, swallowing function, speech therapy, therapy, swallowing, aspiration, speech, communication,"

The patient received 3 nebulizers at home without much improvement.  He was subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to BiPAP.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to the hospitalist service, treated with frequent small volume nebulizers, treated with IV Solu-Medrol and BiPAP support for COPD exacerbation.  The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100s to mid 100s.  The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin.  The patient subsequently responded well as well received IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Zosyn.  The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization.  The patient subsequently was able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed.  The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing BiPAP, was simply using supplemental O2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturations on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula.  The patient was able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and was able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet.  Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow was thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time.  The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions that appeared to be unchanged.  There was also more pronounced patchy alveolar opacity, which appeared to be, ""mass like"" in the right suprahilar region.  This subsequently resolved and the patient's infiltrate slowly improved over the course of his hospitalization.  On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a chest x-ray 2 views, which allowing for differences in technique revealed little change in the bibasilar infiltrates and atelectatic changes at the bases bilaterally.  This was compared with an examination performed 3 days prior.  The patient also had minimal bilateral effusions.  The patient will continue with clindamycin for the next 2 weeks after discharge.

Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.  Her O2 saturations drifted downward.  They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%.  Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis.  She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks.  Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June.  Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.  Methotrexate is known on some occasions to cause pneumonitis.","discharge summary, adrenal insufficiency, hypoxia, cough, fevers, weakness, chills, atypical pneumonia, loose stools, rheumatoid arthritis, azithromycin, arthritis, pneumonia, "

Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS: , The patient was discharged to home.  She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.  Her discharge diet was to be her usual diet of isotonic fiber feeding through the J-tube at a rate of 120 per hour throughout the night.  The discharge medications were as follows:,1.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,2.  Coronary artery disease.,PROCEDURES: , Robotic-Assisted laparoscopic left renal cyst decortication and cystoscopy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mr. ABC is a 70-year-old male who has been diagnosed with a left renal cell carcinoma with multiple renal cysts.  He has undergone MRI of the abdomen on June 18, 2008 revealing an enhancing mass of the upper pole of the left kidney consistent with his history of renal cell carcinoma.  Of note, there are no other enhancing solid masses seen on this MRI.  After discussion of multiple management strategies with the patient including:,1.  Left partial nephrectomy.,2.  Left radical nephrectomy.,3.  Left renal cyst decortication.  The patient is likely to undergo the latter procedure.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to undergo left renal cyst decortication as well as a cystoscopy.  Intraoperatively, approximately four enlarged renal cysts and six smaller renal cysts were initially removed.  The contents were aspirated and careful dissection of the cyst wall was performed.  Multiple specimens of the cyst wall were sent for pathology.  Approximately one liter of cystic fluid was drained during the procedure.  The renal bed was inspected for hemostasis, which appear to be adequate.  There were no complications with the procedure.  Single JP drain was left in place.  Additionally, the patient underwent flexible cystoscopy, which revealed no gross strictures or any other abnormalities in the penile nor prostatic urethra.  Furthermore, no gross lesions were encountered in the bladder.  The patient left OR with transfer to the PACU and subsequently to the hospital floor.,The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful.  His diet and activity were gradually advanced without complication.  On postoperative day #2, he was passing flatus and has had bowel movements.  His Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued on postoperative day #3 that being the day of discharge.  His Foley catheter was removed on the morning of discharge and the patient subsequently passed the voiding trial without difficultly.  At the time of discharge, he was afebrile.  His vital signs indicated hemodynamic stability and he had no evidence of infection.

Hypertension.,5.  Perianal rash.,6.  Diabetes mellitus.,7.  Hypoxia.,8.  Seizure prophylaxis.,9.  Acute kidney injury.,PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:,1.  Cycle five high-dose methotrexate.,2.  Rituxan weekly.,3.  Chest x-ray.,4.  Wound consult.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Ms. ABC is a pleasant 60-year-old Caucasian female who was diagnosed in April 2008 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after she developed visual saltation, changes, and confusion.  Further staging revealed borderline mediastinal pretracheal lymphadenopathy but was otherwise unremarkable.  She began high-dose methotrexate in mid May 2008; courses of methotrexate have been complicated by prolonged methotrexate levels, mental confusion, and mania.  During cycle three, repeat MRI showed interval worsening of disease, and Rituxan was added to her regimen.  Ms. ABC had a repeat MRI on July 24, 2008 prior to this admission, which showed significant improvement in her CNS disease.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Ms. ABC was admitted to the Hematology B Service under attending Dr. Z.,1.  CNS lymphoma.  Upon admission, she was started on her Rituxan, which she tolerated well.  She was then hydrated with bicarbonate solution to a urine pH of 8.  She received methotrexate 5 g/m2.  24-hour creatinine was 0.9, 48-hour methotrexate level was elevated at 2.08.  This was likely secondary to the need to initiate treatment with antibiotics secondary to infection.  Her leucovorin was increased to 100 mg/m2.  72-hour methotrexate level was 0.58.  96-hour methotrexate was 0.16, and 19-hour was 0.08.  She continued additional four doses of oral leucovorin.  Her creatinine improved.  On day prior to discharge, she received her weekly dose of Rituxan.  She will return for Rituxan next week and then return for an appointment with Dr. X on August 18, 2008 with plans for admission for next cycle of methotrexate.,2.  Gram-negative bacteremia.  On the morning of June 27, 2008, Ms. ABC did spike a fever.  She was started on empiric antibiotics with cefepime and vancomycin.  Cultures were drawn peripherally and from the Port-A-Cath which both grew out Gram-negative rods within 12 hours.  After being initiated on IV antibiotics, she remained afebrile for the remainder of the hospitalization.  Both cultures eventually grew out Proteus mirabilis, which was pansensitive.  She had three additional blood cultures, which were all negative.  On the day prior to discharge, she was transitioned to oral Cipro and remained afebrile.  We had intended to send her home with oral antibiotics; however, by day of discharge, she was pancytopenic and it was decided that she should be discharged to complete a 14-day course of IV antibiotics with cefepime.  She will continue this with the assistance of home health services.  She was advised to follow neutropenic precautions and labs will be followed closely as an outpatient.  She understands if she develops a fever greater than 100.5, she should call to return immediately for admission.,3.  Pancytopenia.  On the day of discharge, the patient was pancytopenic with white count of 0.7, ANC of 500, hemoglobin 8.5, hematocrit 24.8, and platelet count 38, 000.  Her labs will be followed closely as an outpatient.  During the admission, we did obtain a HIT antibody, which was negative.  Heparin was held until this level was returned.  She was placed on Arixtra for prophylaxis against thrombus.  It is thought that her decreasing counts may be secondary to infection; however, if she continues to be pancytopenic, she will have a repeat bone marrow as an outpatient.,4.  Hypertension.  Blood pressure remained stable throughout the admission.  She will continue lisinopril daily.,5.  Perianal rash.  Upon admission, she was found to have worsening of a candidal rash in the perianal region.  A wound consult was obtained.  They recommended Aloe Vesta foam and Silver gel to the area topically.  She was also continued on Diflucan 200 mg daily.  She will complete a 10-day course.,6.  Diabetes mellitus.  At the time of admission, she was found to have hyperglycemia.  She was started on sliding scale insulin and eventually started on long-acting Lantus insulin.  She will be discharged with the regimen of Lantus 35 units at bedtime and continue the sliding scale as needed.,7.  Hypoxia.  She did have evidence of decreased saturations.  There was concern that she may have a pneumonia, which was treated with vancomycin for possible hospital acquired pneumonia; however, upon further review of the blood cultures improved, chest x-ray consistent with atelectasis and normal saturations that this was likely secondary to increased fluids associated with methotrexate and atelectasis from being confined to bed.,8.  Seizure prophylaxis.  She will continue Keppra twice daily.,9.  Acute kidney injury.  She did have a bump in the creatinine when methotrexate level was elevated.  This resolved by the time of discharge.  Creatinine on day of discharge is 0.9.

He also needed to continue with dialysis and he needed to improve his rehabilitation.  The patient tolerated his medication well and he was going through rehab fairly well without any significant troubles.  He did have some bouts of issues with constipation on and off throughout his hospitalization, but this seemed to come under control with more aggressive management.  The patient had remained afebrile.  He did also have a bout with some episodic confusion problems, which appeared to be more of a sundowner-type of a problem, but this too cleared with his stay here at Promise.  On the day of discharge, on May 9, 2008, the patient was in good spirits, was very clear and lucid.  He denied any complaints of pain.  He did have some trouble with sleep at night at times, but I think this was mainly tied into the fact that he sleeps a lot during the day.

Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.  Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,2.  Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,3.  Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008).,4.

3945, Patient with fever of unknown origin., Discharge Summary, Discharge Summary - 7 ,"REASON FOR ADMISSION: , Fever of unknown origin.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 39-year-old woman with polymyositis/dermatomyositis on methotrexate once a week.  The patient has also been on high-dose prednisone for an urticarial rash.  The patient was admitted because of persistent high fevers without a clear-cut source of infection.  She had been having temperatures of up to 103 for 8-10 days.  She had been seen at Alta View Emergency Department a week prior to admission.  A workup there including chest x-ray, blood cultures, and a transthoracic echocardiogram had all remained nondiagnostic, and were normal.  Her chest x-ray on that occasion was normal.  After the patient was seen in the office on August 10, she persisted with high fevers and was admitted on August 11 to Cottonwood Hospital.  Studies done at Cottonwood:  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Results:  CT chest showed mild bibasilar pleural-based interstitial changes.  These were localized to mid and lower lung zones.  The process was not diffuse.  There was no ground glass change.  CT abdomen and pelvis was normal.  Infectious disease consultation was obtained.  Dr. XYZ saw the patient.  He ordered serologies for CMV including a CMV blood PCR.  Next serologies for EBV, Legionella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Coccidioides, and cryptococcal antigen, and a PPD.  The CMV serology came back positive for IgM.  The IgG was negative.  The CMV blood PCR was positive, as well.  Other serologies and her PPD stayed negative.  Blood cultures stayed negative.,In view of the positive CMV, PCR, and the changes in her CAT scan, the patient was taken for a bronchoscopy.  BAL and transbronchial biopsies were performed.  The transbronchial biopsies did not show any evidence of pneumocystis, fungal infection, AFB.  There was some nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, which was minimal.  I spoke with the pathologist, Dr. XYZ and immunopathology was done to look for CMV.  The patient had 3 nucleoli on the biopsy specimens that stained positive and were consistent with CMV infection.  The patient was started on ganciclovir once her CMV serologies had come back positive.  No other antibiotic therapy was prescribed.  Next, the patient's methotrexate was held.,A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed some bibasilar disease, showing interstitial infiltrates.  The patient was given ibuprofen and acetaminophen during her hospitalization, and her fever resolved with these measures.,On the BAL fluid cell count, the patient only had 5 WBCs and 5 RBCs on the differential.  It showed 43% neutrophils, 45% lymphocytes.,Discussions were held with Dr. XYZ, Dr. XYZ, her rheumatologist, and with pathology.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Disseminated CMV infection with possible CMV pneumonitis.,2.  Polymyositis on immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate and prednisone).,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:,1.  The patient is going to go on ganciclovir 275 mg IV q.12 h. for approximately 3 weeks.,2.  Advair 100/50, 1 puff b.i.d.,3.  Ibuprofen p.r.n. and Tylenol p.r.n. for fever, and will continue her folic acid.,4.  The patient will not restart for methotrexate for now.,She is supposed to follow up with me on August 22, 2007 at 1:45 p.m.  She is also supposed to see Dr. XYZ in 2 weeks, and Dr. XYZ in 2-3 weeks.  She also has an appointment to see an ophthalmologist in about 10 days' time.  This was a prolonged discharge, more than 30 minutes were spent on discharging this patient.","discharge summary, fever of unknown origin, blood cultures, transbronchial biopsies, infection, cmv, admission, illness, interstitial, fever, serologies, chest, nondiagnostic, methotrexate"

She had her pain controlled with p.o. pain medicine.  She was afebrile.  She is tolerating liquid diet.  It was felt that the patient is stable for discharge.  She did complain of bladder spasms when she urinated and she did say that she has a history of chronic UTIs.  We will check a UA and urine culture prior to discharge.  I will give her prescription for ciprofloxacin that she can take for 3 days presumptively and I have discharged her home with omeprazole and Colace to take over-the-counter for constipation and we will send her home with Percocet for pain.  Her labs were within normal limits.  She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related.  Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits.  Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed.  They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively.  I feel that she looks good for discharge.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Clear liquid diet x48 hours and she can return to her Medifast, she may shower.  She needs to keep her wound clean and dry.  She is not to engage in any heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds x2 weeks.  No driving for 1 to 2 weeks.

3947, A white female with a history of fevers., Discharge Summary, Discharge Summary - 8 ,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Gram-negative rod bacteremia, final identification and susceptibilities still pending.,2.  History of congenital genitourinary abnormalities with multiple surgeries before the 5th grade.,3.  History of urinary tract infections of pyelonephritis.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED: , Chest x-ray July 24, 2007, that was normal.  Transesophageal echocardiogram July 27, 2007, that was normal.  No evidence of vegetations.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis July 27, 2007, that revealed multiple small cysts in the liver, the largest measuring 9 mm.  There were 2-3 additional tiny cysts in the right lobe.  The remainder of the CT scan was normal.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Briefly, the patient is a 26-year-old white female with a history of fevers.  For further details of the admission, please see the previously dictated history and physical.  ,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Gram-negative rod bacteremia.  The patient was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of endocarditis given the fact that she had fever, septicemia, and Osler nodes on her fingers.  The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram as an outpatient, which was equivocal, but a transesophageal echocardiogram here in the hospital was normal with no evidence of vegetations.  The microbiology laboratory stated that the Gram-negative rod appeared to be anaerobic, thus raising the possibility of organisms like bacteroides.  The patient does have a history of congenital genitourinary abnormalities which were surgically corrected before the fifth grade.  We did a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which only showed some benign appearing cysts in the liver.  There was nothing remarkable as far as her kidneys, ureters, or bladder were concerned.  I spoke with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases, and Dr. XYZ asked me to talk to the patient about any contact with animals, given the fact that we have had a recent outbreak of tularemia here in Utah.  Much to my surprise, the patient told me that she had multiple pet rats at home, which she was constantly in contact with.  I ordered tularemia and leptospirosis serologies on the advice of Dr. XYZ, and as of the day after discharge, the results of the microbiology still are not back yet.  The patient, however, appeared to be responding well to levofloxacin.  I gave her a 2-week course of 750 mg a day of levofloxacin, and I have instructed her to follow up with Dr. XYZ in the meantime.  Hopefully by then we will have a final identification and susceptibility on the organism and the tularemia and leptospirosis serologies will return.  A thought of ours was to add doxycycline, but again the patient clinically appeared to be responding to the levofloxacin.  In addition, I told the patient that it would be my recommendation to get rid of the rats.  I told her that if indeed the rats were carriers of infection and she received a zoonotic infection from exposure to the rats, that she could be in ongoing continuing danger and her children could also potentially be exposed to a potentially lethal infection.  I told her very clearly that she should, indeed, get rid of the animals.  The patient seemed reluctant to do so at first, but I believe with some coercion from her family, that she finally came to the realization that this was a recommendation worth following.,  ,DISPOSITION,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Activity is as tolerated.  Diet is as tolerated.,MEDICATIONS: , Levaquin 750 mg daily x14 days.,Followup is with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases.  I gave the patient the phone number to call on Monday for an appointment.  Additional followup is also with Dr. XYZ, her primary care physician.  Please note that 40 minutes was spent in the discharge.","discharge summary, abdomen and pelvis, gram negative rod, congenital genitourinary, genitourinary abnormalities, transesophageal echocardiogram, infectious diseases, leptospirosis serologies, gram negative, ct scan, identification, infections, levofloxacin, additional, discharge"

She denied history of chest pain or fevers or cough with purulent sputum at that time. She was empirically treated with a course of antibiotics of Avelox for ten days. She also received steroids, prednisolone 60 mg, and breathing treatments with albuterol, Ipratropium and her bronchodilator therapy was also optimized with theophylline. She continued to receive Coumadin for her chronic atrial fibrillation. Her heart rate was controlled and was maintained in the 60s-70s. On the third day of admission she developed worsening respiratory failure with fatigue, and hence was required to be intubated and ventilated. She was put on mechanical ventilation from 1/29 to 2/6/06. She was extubated on 2/6 and put on BI-PAP.

Her symptoms progressed and she presented to the emergency room at Brighton Gardens where a chest x-ray revealed evolving right lobar infiltrate.  She was started on antibiotics.  Infectious Disease was consulted.  She was initially begun on vancomycin.  Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were obtained; the results of which were negative for infection.  She was switched to IV Levaquin and received IV Flagyl for possible C. diff colitis as well as possible cholecystitis.  During her hospital stay, she initially was extremely relatively hypotensive with mild symptoms and she became dizzy with upright positioning.  Her systolic blood pressure was 60-70 mmHg despite rather aggressive IV fluid management up to 250 mL an hour.  She was seen in consultation by Dr. Y who monitored her fluid and pulmonary treatment.  Due to some elevated liver function tests, she was seen in consultation by Dr. X.  An ultrasound was negative; however, she did undergo CT scan of the chest and abdomen and there was a suspicion of fluid circling the gallbladder.  A HIDA scan was performed and revealed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction.  Liver functions were monitored throughout her stay and while elevated, did reduce to approximately 1.5 times normal value.  She also was seen in consultation by Infectious Disease who followed her for several days and agreed with current management of antibiotics.  Over her week-stay, the patient was moderately hypoxemic with room air pulse oximetry of 90%.  She was placed on incentive spirometry and over the succeeding days, she did have improved pulmonary function.,LABORATORY TESTS: , Initially revealed a white count of 13,000, however, approximately 24 hours following admission her white count stabilized and in fact remained normal throughout her stay.  Blood cultures were negative at 5 days.  Sputum culture was negative.  Urine culture was negative and thoracentesis culture negative at 24 hours.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells with the hemoglobin drop to 9 for cardiovascular support, as no evidence of GI bleeding was obtained.  Her most recent blood work on 6/14/2009 revealed a white count of 7000 and hemoglobin of 12.1 with a hematocrit of 36.8.  Her PT and PTT were normal.  Occult blood studies were negative for occult blood.  Hepatitis B antigen was negative.  Hepatitis A antibody IgM was negative.  Hepatitis B core IgM negative, and hepatitis C core antibody was negative.  At the time of discharge on 6/14/2009, sodium was 135, potassium was 3.7, calcium was 8.0, her ALT was 109, AST was 70, direct bilirubin was 0.2, LDH was 219, serum iron was 7, total iron unbound 183, and ferritin level was 267.,At the time of discharge, the patient had improved.

The patient was brought to the operative suite where he was placed in supine position and general endotracheal tube intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away and a shoulder roll was placed and a McIvor mouthgag was inserted into the oral cavity.  Correct inspection and palpation did not reveal evidence of a bifid uvula or submucosal clots.  Attention was directed first to the right tonsil in which a curved Allis forceps was applied to the superior pole.  The needle-tip Bovie cautery was used to incise the mucosa of the anterior tonsillar pillar.  Once the tonsillar pillar was identified and the superior pole was released, the curved forceps with a straight Allis forceps and the dissection was carried down inferiorly, dissecting the tonsil free from all fascial attachments.  Once the tonsil was delivered from the oral cavity, hemostasis was obtained within the tonsillar fossa utilizing suction cautery.,Attention was then directed over to the left tonsil in which a similar procedure was performed.  Once all bleeding was controlled, the mucosa of both the hard and soft palate was anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:50000 epinephrine solution.  Now attention was directed to the posterior pillars.  A hemostat was used to clamp the posterior pillar, which was then taken down with Metzenbaum scissors.  The posterior pillar was then approximated to the anterior pillar with the use of #3-0 PDS suture so as to create a box shaped soft palate.  Now, the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and #12 blade scalpel was used to incise the mucosa of the soft palate extending down onto the uvula.  The mucosa was dissected off with the use of Potts scissors.  Now the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and sutured down in place with use of #3-0 PDS suture approximated with deep muscle layers.  Now the mucosa of the soft palate and the uvula were approximated with interrupted #3-0 PDS sutures.  Finally, #4-0 Vicryl sutures were placed intermittently between the PDS to further secure the uvula, which had been reflected onto the soft palate.  A final #3-0 PDS suture was used to further approximate the anterior and posterior tonsil pillars.  Final inspection did not reveal any further bleeding.  The mouth was then irrigated with saline and suctioned.  At this point, the procedure was complete.  He was awakened and taken to recovery room in stable condition.  He will be admitted as an observation patient to the Telemetry Floor for routine postoperative management.  Of note, IV Decadron was administered during the procedure.","ent - otolaryngology, endotracheal, metzenbaum, soft palate, obstructive sleep apnea, tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, obstructive, mucosa, uvula, palate,"

She confirms the history of loud snoring at night with witnessed apnea.  The result of the sleep study was reviewed.  This showed moderate sleep apnea with significant desaturation.  The patient was unable to tolerate treatment with CPAP.  At the office, we observed large tonsils and elongation and thickening of the uvula as well as redundant soft tissue of the palate.  A tortuous appearance of the septum also was observed.  This morning, I talked to the patient and his wife about the findings.  I reviewed the CT images.  He has no history of sinus infections and does not recall a history of nasal trauma.  We discussed the removal of tonsils and uvula and soft palate tissue and the hope that this would help with his airway.  Depending on the findings of surgery, I explained that I might remove that bone spur that we are seeing within the nasal passage.  I will get the best look at it when he is asleep.  We discussed recovery as well.  He visited with Dr. XYZ about the anesthetic produce.,PROCEDURE:,:  General tracheal anesthetic was administered by Dr. XYZ and Mr. Radke.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils and a cottonoid soaked with Afrin was placed in each side of the nose.  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag was placed.  The tonsils were very large and touched the uvula.  The uvula was relatively long and very thick and there were redundant folds of soft palate mucosa and prominent posterior and anterior tonsillar pillars.  Also, there was a cryptic appearance of the tonsils but there was no acute redness or exudate.  Retraction of the soft palate permitted evaluation of the nasopharynx with the mirror and the choanae were patent and there was no adenoid tissue present.  A very crowded pharynx was appreciated.  The tonsils were first removed using electrodissection technique.  Hemostasis was achieved with the electrocautery and with sutures of 0 plain catgut.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  There already was more room in the pharynx, but the posterior pharyngeal wall was still obscured by the soft palate and uvula.  The uvula was grasped with the Alice clamp.  I palpated the posterior edge of the hard palate and calculated removal of about a third of the length of the soft palate.  We switched over from the Bayonet cautery to the blunt needle tip electrocautery.  The planned anterior soft palate incision was marked out with the electrocautery from the left anterior tonsillar pillar rising upwards and then extending horizontally across the soft palate to include all of the uvula and a portion of the soft palate, and the incision then extended across the midline and then inferiorly to meet the right anterior tonsillar pillar.  This incision was then deepened with the electrocautery on a cutting current.  The uvular artery just to the right of the midline was controlled with the suction electrocautery.  The posterior soft palate incision was made parallel to the anterior soft palate incision but was made leaving a longer length of mucosa to permit closure of the palatoplasty.  A portion of the redundant soft palate mucosa tissue also was included with the resection specimen and the tissue including the soft palate and uvula was included with the surgical specimen as the tonsils were sent to pathology.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The soft palate was also injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The posterior tonsillar pillars were then brought forward to close to the anterior tonsillar pillars and these were sutured down to the tonsil bed with interrupted 0 plain catgut sutures.  The posterior soft palate mucosa was advanced forward and brought up to the anterior soft palate incision and closure of the soft palate wound was then accomplished with interrupted 3-0 chromic catgut sutures.  A much improved appearance of the oropharynx with a greatly improved airway was appreciated.  A moist tonsil sponge was placed into the nasopharynx and the mouth gag was removed.  I removed the cottonoids from both nostrils.  Speculum exam showed the inferior turbinates were large, the septum was tortuous and it angulated to the right and then sharply bent back to the left.  The septum was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine using a separate syringe and needle.  A #15 blade was used to make a left cheilion incision.,Mucoperichondrium and mucoperiosteum were elevated with the Cottle elevator.  When we reached the deflected portion of the vomer, this was separated from the septal cartilage with a Freer elevator.  The right-sided mucoperiosteum was elevated with the Freer elevator and then with Takahashi forceps and with the 4 mm osteotome, the deflected portion of the septal bone from the vomer was resected.  This tissue also was sent as a separate specimen to pathology.  The intraseptal space was irrigated with saline and suctioned.  The nasal septal mucosal flaps were then sutured together with a quilting suture of 4-0 plain catgut.  I observed no evidence of purulent secretion or polyp formation within the nostrils.  The inferior turbinates were then both outfractured using a knife handle, and now there was a much more patent nasal airway on both sides.  There was good support for the nasal tip and the dorsum and there was good hemostasis within the nose.  No packing was used in the nostrils.  Polysporin ointment was introduced into both nostrils.  The mouth gag was reintroduced and the pack removed from the nasopharynx.  The nose and throat were irrigated with saline and suctioned.  An orogastric tube was placed and a moderate amount of clear fluid suctioned from the stomach and this tube was removed.  Sponge and needle count were reported correct.  The mouth gag having been withdrawn, the patient was then awakened and returned to recovery room in a satisfactory condition.  He tolerated the operation excellently.  Estimated blood loss was about 15-20 cc.  In the recovery room, I observed that he was moving air well and I spoke with his wife about the findings of surgery.","ent - otolaryngology, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, afrin drops, bayonet cautery, cpap, cottle elevator, crowe-davis, freer elevator, obstructive sleep apnea, tonsillectomy, hypertrophy, mouth gag, nasal, nasal passage, nasal septum, nasopharynx, nostrils, palate, pharynx, septal cartilage, septoplasty, sleep apnea, soft palate, tonsils, uvula, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, hypertrophy of tonsils, anterior tonsillar pillars, soft palate incision, palate incision, tonsillar pillars, incision "

He had required ventilator assistance and was transported to the ICU setting.  Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.

She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthetic was administered.  Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy.  He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx.  Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa.  This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris.  Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts.  With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads.  The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique.  The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic.  It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction.  The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle.  The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.  The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic.  She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to the postoperative recovery room area.,Estimated blood loss was minimal.  There were no complications.  Specimens produced were right and left tonsils.  The adenoid pad was ablated with electrocautery.","ent - otolaryngology, obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy, pharyngitis, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, uvula, obstructive, adenotonsillar, hypertrophy, hypertrophic, fossa, tonsils, oropharynx, electrocautery, pads"

Left canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy with ossicular chain reconstruction.,2.  Microdissection.,3.  NIM facial nerve monitoring for three hours.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,FINDINGS:,  There is an extremely large canal cholesteatoma, which eroded most of the posterior and superior canal wall.  There was a significant amount of myringosclerosis and tympanosclerosis.  There is some mild erosion of the lenticular process of the incus.  The facial nerve was normal.  We removed the incus, removed the head of the malleus, and placed a titanium-PORP from the stapes capitulum to a cartilage graft.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed under general anesthetic and intubated without difficulty.  The NIM facial nerve monitoring electrodes were positioned and monitoring was performed throughout the procedure.  There was no abnormal activity during this case.  We inspected the ear canal, identified the huge defect, which was completely filled with cerumen.  Through the ear canal, we removed as much as we could and then infiltrated the canal and postauricular area with 1:100,000 of epinephrine.,We prepped and draped the ear in a sterile fashion.  We reopened the previously used postauricular incision and dissected down the mastoid cortex.  We reflected the soft tissues anteriorly to the level of the ear canal and identified where the ear canal skin entered the defect in the mastoid bone.  A #6 cutting bur was used to drill down the mastoid cortex and identified this cholesteatoma which was then carefully dissected out.  We went all the way to the mastoid antrum.  We finished a complete mastoidectomy with identification of the tegmen, sigmoid sinus.  We removed the lateral aspect of the mastoid tip.  We lowered the facial ridge.  The incudostapedial joint was already membranous in nature, we went ahead and used the joint knife and removed the incus.  We separated the incus from the stapes and then removed it.  We used a malleus head nipper to remove the head of the malleus and then we continued to saucerize the entire mastoid cavity.,There was no cholesteatoma within the middle ear space, but there was roughly 40% surface area perforation.  The remaining portion of the tympanic membrane was extremely calcified and myringosclerotic; this was removed.  There was also a large focus of tympanosclerosis between the stapes crura, which was impinging the ability of the stapes to move.  We carefully dissected this out.  This did seem to improve the mobility of the stapes somewhat.  At this point, there was a near total perforation.  There was only a minimal amount of anterior remnant of the drum left.  We tried to go ahead and harvest the temporalis fascia, but there was really only wisps of this fascia in place.  He had already had a previous tympanoplasty, but even outside the areas where the graft was taken, the temporalis muscle was quite atrophied and lumpy, and I suspect this was due to his chronic disease and long history of corticosteroid usage.  We harvested a few pieces as best as we could.  We went ahead and did a meatoplasty by making a canal incision in the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions.  We excised cartilage posteriorly and inferiorly to enlarge the meatus.  This cartilage was thin and used for cartilage tympanoplasty.  We placed some Gelfoam in the middle ear space and placed the cartilage on the top of it.  We did cut a titanium-PORP of the proper side and placed on top of the stapes capitulum to interface with the cartilage cap.  A few other small pieces of temporalis fascia were used to bulge through the surrounding edges of the cartilage and make sure that it was medial to any remnant of ear canal and tympanic membrane remnants.  We placed a layer of Gelfoam lateral to the graft, closed the postauricular incision in layers and put 2 Merocel packs in the ear.  Glasscock dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  He will be given antibiotics and pain medicines and he will be given instructions to follow up with me in one week.","ent - otolaryngology, cholesteatoma, gelfoam, glasscock dressing, microdissection, nim, canal, canal wall, cerumen, facial nerve, incus, myringosclerosis, ossicular chain reconstruction, titanium-porp, tympanomastoidectomy, tympanosclerosis, facial nerve monitoring, ear canal, cartilage, ear,"

The patient has had approximately four to five episodes of adenotonsillitis per year for the last three to four years.,PROCEDURE: , Informed consent was properly obtained from the patient's parents and the patient was taken to the operating room #3 and was placed in a supine position.  He was placed under general endotracheal tube anesthesia by the Department of Anesthesia.  The bed was then rolled away from Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed beneath the shoulder blades and a blue towel was then fashioned as a turban wrap.  The McIvor mouth gag was carefully positioned into the patient's mouth with attention to avoid the teeth.,The retractor was then opened and the oropharynx was visualized.  The adenoid pad was then visualized with a laryngeal mirror.  The adenoids appeared to be 1+ and non-obstructing.  There was no evidence of submucosal cleft palate palpable.  There was no evidence of bifid uvula.  A curved Allis clamp was then used to grasp the superior pole of the right tonsil.  The tonsil was then retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision on the mucosa of the right anterior tonsillar pillar to find the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using a Bovie.  Tonsillar sponge was re-applied to the tonsillar fossa.  Suction cautery was then used to adequately obtain hemostasis with the tonsillar fossa.  Attention was then directed to the left tonsil.  The curved Allis was used to grasp the superior pole of the left tonsil and it was retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision in the mucosa of the left anterior tonsillar pillar and define the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using the Bovie.  Next, complete hemostasis was achieved within the tonsillar fossae using suction cautery.  After adequate hemostasis was obtained, attention was directed towards the adenoid pad.  The adenoid pad was again visualized and appeared 1+ and was non-obstructing.  Decision was made to use suction cautery to cauterize the adenoids.  Using a laryngeal mirror under direct visualization, the adenoid pad was then cauterized with care to avoid the eustachian tube orifices as well as the soft palate and inferior turbinates.  After cauterization was complete, the nasopharynx was again visualized and tonsillar sponge was applied.  Adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The tonsillar fossae were again visualized and no evidence of bleeding was evident.  The throat pack was removed from the oropharynx and the oropharynx was suctioned.  There was no evidence of any further bleeding.  A flexible suction catheter was then used to suction out the nasopharynx to the oropharynx.  The suction catheter was also used to suction up the stomach.  Final look revealed no evidence of further bleeding and 10 mg of Decadron was given intraoperatively.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition.","ent - otolaryngology, chronic adenotonsillitis, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, adenoid, tonsils, tonsillar fossa, tonsillar fossae, suction cautery, adenotonsillitis, oropharynx, hemostasis, cautery, suction, tonsillar"

The McIvor mouth gag was inserted and gently suspended.  Afrin was instilled in both sides of the nose and allowed to take effect for a period of time.  The hypertrophic tonsils were then removed by the suction and snare.  Deeply cryptic changes as expected were evident.  Bleeding was minimal and controlled with packing followed by electrocautery followed by extensive additional irrigation.  An inspection of the nasopharynx confirmed that the adenoids were in fact hypertrophic rubbery cryptic and obstructive.  They were shaved back, flushed with prevertebral fascia with curette.  Hemostasis established with packing followed by electrocautery.  In light of his history of recurring nosebleeds, both sides of the nose were carefully inspected.  A nasal endoscope was used to identify the plexus of bleeding, which was predominantly on the left mid portion of the septum that was controlled with broad superficial cauterization using a suction cautery device.  The bleeding was admittedly a bit of a annoyance.  An additional control was established by infiltrating slowly with a 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine around the perimeter of the bleeding site and then cauterizing the bleeding site itself.  No additional bleeding was then evident.  The oropharynx was reinspected, clots removed, the patient was extubated, taken to the recovery room in stable condition.

She is here this morning with her Mom.  She has very large tonsils and she snores at night and gets up frequently at night and does not sleep well.  At the office we saw the tonsils were very big.  There was a rock in the right ear and it was very deep in the canal, near the drum.  We will remove the foreign body under the same anesthetic.,PROCEDURE:,:  Natalie was placed under general anesthetic by the orotracheal route of administration, under Dr. XYZ and Ms. B.  I looked into the left ear under the microscope, took out a little wax and observed a normal eardrum.  On the right side, I took out some impacted wax and removed the rock with a large suction.  It was actually resting on the surface of the drum but had not scarred or damaged the drum.  The drum was intact with no evidence of middle ear fluid.  The microscope was set aside.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils.  The neck was gently extended and the Crowe-Davis mouth gag inserted.  The tonsils and adenoids were very large.  The uvula was intact.

Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution.  A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon.  This could later be removed in bishop.  A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished.  A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock.  Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation.  Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus.  An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament.  The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain.  Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified.  Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement.  A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani.  The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well.  The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse.  The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured.  The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation.  A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston.  The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen.  It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate.  The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate.  A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus.  Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position.  Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph.  A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction.  The mobility appeared excellent.  The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position.  The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment.  She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop.  Sutures will be out in a week and a recheck in Reno in four to five weeks from now.","ent - otolaryngology, bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss, argon laser assisted, conductive hearing losses, intubation, argon, stapedectomy, otosclerosis, canal, earlobe, prosthesis, pledgets, laser"

There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT.  The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  Many cultures were taken from several areas.  The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.  When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures.,Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed.  The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel.  After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,Good hemostasis was observed.  Sponge count was reported as being correct.  Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl.  The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.","ent - otolaryngology, empyema, biopsies, bronchus, declaudication, endothoracic, hydropneumothorax, left lower lobe, left lung, left upper lobe, mainstem, pleura, thoracoscopy, thoracotomy, thoracotomy with declaudication, declaudication and drainage, double lumen tube, sixth intercostal space, lung abscesses, pleural cavity, intercostal space, upper lobe, double lumen, chest tube, cavity, tube, chest, lung, pulmonary, pleural, intercostal,"

Also, I cleaned out his maxillary sinuses.  Symptoms included loud snoring at night, sinus infections, throat infections, not sleeping well, and fatigue.  The surgery went well, and I had planned for him to stay overnight, but Mom reminds me that by about 8 p.m. the night nurse gotten him to take fluids well and we let him go home then that evening.  He finished up his Augmentin, by a day or two later he was off the Lortab.  Mom has not noticed any unusual voice change.  No swallowing difficulty except he does not like the taste of acidic foods such as tomato sauce.  He has not had any nasal discharge or ever had any bleeding.  He seems to be breathing better.,OBJECTIVE:,  Exam looks good.  The pharynx is well healed.  Tongue mobility is normal.  Voice sounds clear.  Nasal passages reveal no discharge or crusting.,RECOMMENDATION:,  I told Mom it is okay to use some ibuprofen in case his mouth or jaws are still sensitive.  He says it seems to hurt if he opens his mouth real wide such as when he brushes his teeth.  It is okay to chew gum and it is okay to eat crunchy foods such as potato chips.  The pathologist described the expected changes of chronic sinusitis and chronic hypertrophic tonsillitis and adenoiditis, and there were no atypical findings on the laboratories.,I am glad he has healed up well.  There are no other restrictions or limitations.  I told Mom, I had written to Dr. XYZ to let her know of the findings.  The child will continue his regular followup visits with his family doctor, and I told Mom I would be happy to see him anytime if needed.  He did very well after surgery and he seems to feel better and breathe a lot better after his throat and sinus procedure.","ent - otolaryngology, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, maxillary, nasal, sinuses,"

The patient had a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy performed in the office which demonstrated the mass and confirmed also on CT scan.  The patient also has had this right upper lid skin lesion which appears to be a cholesterol granuloma for numerous months.  It appears to be growing in size and is irregularly bordered.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed to the patient, a written consent was obtained for the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was turned to 90 degrees by the Department of Anesthesia.  The right upper eyelid skin lesion was injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 1 cc total.  After this, the patient's bilateral nasal passages were then packed with cocaine-soaked cottonoids of 10% solution of 4 cc total.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and the right upper lid skin was then first cut around the skin lesion utilizing a Superblade.  After this, the skin lesion was then grasped with a ________ in the  superior aspect and the skin lesion was cut and removed in the subcutaneous plane utilizing Westcott scissors.  After this, the ________ was then hemostatically controlled with monopolar cauterization.  The patient's skin was then reapproximated with a running #6-0 Prolene suture.  A Mastisol along with a single Steri-Strip was in place followed Maxitrol ointment.  Attention then was drawn to the nasopharynx.  The cocaine-soaked cottonoids were removed from the nasal passages bilaterally and zero-degree otoscope was placed all the way to the patient's nasopharynx.  The patient had a severely deviated nasal septum more so to the right than the left.  There appeared to be a spur on the left inferior aspect and also on the right posterior aspect.  The nasopharyngeal mass appeared polypoid in nature almost lymphoid tissue looking.  It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 of approximately 3 cc total.  After this, the lesion was then removed on the right side with the XPS blade.  The torus tubarius was noted on the left side with the polypoid lymphoid tissue involving this area completely.  This area was taken down with the XPS blade.  Prior to taking down this lesion with the XPS, multiple biopsies were taken with a straight biter.  After this, a cocaine-soaked cottonoid was placed back in the patient's left nasal passage region and the nasopharynx and the attention was then drawn to the right side.  The zero-degree otoscope was placed in the patient's right nasal passage and all the way to the nasopharynx.  Again, the XPS was then utilized to take down the nasopharyngeal mass in its entirety with some involvement overlying the torus tubarius.  After this, the patient was then hemostatically controlled with suctioned Bovie cauterization.  A FloSeal was then placed followed by bilateral Merocels and bacitracin-coated ointment.  The patient's Meroceles were then tied together to the patient's forehead and the patient was then turned back to the Anesthesia.

3712, A sample note on serous otitis media, ENT - Otolaryngology, SOM - Serous Otitis Media ,"Because children need hearing to learn speech, hearing loss from fluid in the middle ear can result in speech delay.  Children begin to speak some words by 18 months.  Children with fluid in both ears can show significant delay in their use of language.  In addition, young children learn to pronounce words by hearing them spoken.  When there is a hearing loss, even a mild one, the spoken words of parents and siblings are distorted to the child with fluid in the ears.  Identification of fluid in the middle ear is important, not only to prevent future speech problems, but to avoid permanent damage to the eardrum and the middle ear.  Most children will have at least one ear infection before the age of four.,With treatment, the ear infections clear up promptly.  Without the follow-up visit, fluid may still be present, even though the child has no complaints or symptoms.  Therefore, it is essential that ear infections be rechecked after initial treatment.  Usually, the presence of fluid results in a ""mild conductive hearing loss."" This could be as much as 30% hearing loss overall.  After the specialist confirms that fluid is present behind both eardrums, further medical treatment is often advised.  This may consist of additional antibiotics, decongestants, and in some cases, nasal sprays.  If fluid has been present for over 12 weeks, surgical drainage of the fluid is often indicated.  The decision to perform surgery should be based on the response to medical treatment, the degree of hearing loss and the appearance of the eardum itself under the surgical microscope.  Surgery which drains fluid involves a small incision in the eardrum, so that the fluid can be gently removed and a tube can be inserted.  The procedure, medically termed a myringotomy and tubes, or tympanostomy and tube, (BMT if Bilateral) or PET (Pressure Equalizing Tubes), is performed on children under general anesthesia.","ent - otolaryngology, tube, bmt, pet, pressure equalizing tubes, serous otitis media, eustachian tube, ear infections, otitis media, middle ear, hearing loss, ear, children, fluid, drain, eustachian, otitis, media, eardrum, infections, middle, loss, hearingNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

He now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.

After adequate anesthesia via endotracheal intubation, the nose was prepped with Afrin nasal spray.  After this was done, 1% Xylocaine with 100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in both sides of the septum and the mucoperichondrium.  After this, the sinus endoscope at 25-degrees was then used to examine the nasal cavity in the left nasal cavity and staying lateral to the middle turbinate.  A 45-degree forceps then used to open up the maxillary sinus.  There was some prominent tissue and just superior to this, the anterior ethmoid was opened.  The 45-degree forceps was then used to open the maxillary sinus ostium.  This was enlarged with backbiting rongeur.  After this was done, the tissue found in the ethmoid and maxillary sinus were removed and sent to pathology and labeled as left maxillary sinus mucosa.  After this was done, attention was then turned to the right nasal cavity staying laterally to the middle turbinate.  There was noted to have prominence in the anterior ethmoidal area.  This was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  This mucosa was then removed from the anterior area.  The maxillary sinus ostium was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  Tissue was removed from this area.  This was sent as right maxillary mucosa.  After this, the backbiting rongeur was then used to open up the ostium and enlarge the ostium on the right maxillary sinus.  Protecting the eyes with wet gauze and using KTP laser at 10 watts, the sinus endoscope was used for observation and the submucosal resection was done of both inferior turbinates as well as anterior portion of the middle turbinates bilaterally.  This was to open up to expose the maxillary ostium as well as other sinus ostium to minimize swelling and obstruction.  After this was completed, a septoplasty was performed.  The incision was made with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The flap was then elevated, overlying the spur that was protruding into the right nasal cavity.  This was excised with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The tissue was then laid back in position.  After this was laid back in position, the nasal cavity was irrigated with saline solution, suctioned well as well as the oropharynx.  , ,Surgicel with antibiotic ointment was placed in each nostril and sutured outside the nose with 3-0 nylon.

Left conchal cartilage harvest (CPT 21235).,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This patient is an otherwise healthy male who had a previous nasal fracture.  During his healing, perioperatively he did sustain a hockey puck to the nose resulting in a saddle-nose deformity with septal hematoma.  The patient healed status post rhinoplasty as a result but was left with a persistent saddle-nose dorsal defect.  The patient was consented for the above-stated procedure.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient did have approximately 12 mL of Lidocaine with epinephrine 1% with 1:100,000 infiltrated into the nasal soft tissues.  In addition to this, cocaine pledgets were placed to assist with hemostasis.,At this point, attention was turned to the left ear.  Approximately 3 mL of 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissues of the conchal bulb.  Betadine was utilized for preparation.  A 15 blade was used to incise along the posterior conchal area and a Freer elevator was utilized to lift the soft tissues off the conchal cartilage in a submucoperichondrial plane.  I then completed this along the posterior aspect of the conchal cartilage, was transected in the concha cavum and concha cymba, both were harvested.  These were placed aside in saline.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar electrocauterization.  Bovie electrocauterization was also employed as needed.  The entire length of the wound was then closed with 5-0 plain running locking suture.  The patient then had a Telfa placed both anterior and posterior to the conchal defect and placed in a sandwich dressing utilizing a 2-0 Prolene suture.  Antibiotic ointment was applied generously.,Next, attention was turned to opening and lifting the soft tissues of the nose.  A typical external columella inverted V gull-wing incision was placed on the columella and trailed into a marginal incision.  The soft tissues of the nose were then elevated using curved sharp scissors and Metzenbaums.  Soft tissues were elevated over the lower lateral cartilages, upper lateral cartilages onto the nasal dorsum.  At this point, attention was turned to osteotomies and examination of the external cartilages.,The patient did have very broad lower lateral cartilages leading to a bulbous tip.  The lower lateral cartilages were trimmed in a symmetrical fashion leaving at least 8 mm of lower lateral cartilage bilaterally along the lateral aspect.  Having completed this, the patient had medial and lateral osteotomies performed with a 2-mm osteotome.  These were done transmucosally after elevating the tract using a Cottle elevator.  Direct hemostasis pressure was applied to assist with bruising.,Next, attention was turned to tip mechanisms.  The patient had a series of double-dome sutures placed into the nasal tip.  Then, 5-0 Dexon was employed for intradomal suturing, 5-0 clear Prolene was used for interdomal suturing.  Having completed this, a 5-0 clear Prolene alar spanning suture was employed to narrow the superior tip area.,Next, attention was turned to dorsal augmentation.  A Gore-Tex small implant had been selected, previously incised.  This was taken to the back table and carved under sterile conditions.  The patient then had the implant placed into the super-tip area to assist with support of the nasal dorsum.  It was placed into a precise pocket and remained in the midline.,Next, attention was turned to performing a columella strut.  The cartilage from the concha was shaped into a strut and placed into a precision pocket between the medial footplate of the lower lateral cartilage.  This was fixed into position utilizing a 5-0 Dexon suture.,Having completed placement of all augmentation grafts, the patient was examined for hemostasis.  The external columella inverted gull-wing incision along the nasal tip was closed with a series of interrupted everting 6-0 black nylon sutures.  The entire marginal incisions for cosmetic rhinoplasty were closed utilizing a series of 5-0 plain interrupted sutures.,At the termination of the case, the ear was inspected and the position of the conchal cartilage harvest was hemostatic.  There was no evidence of hematoma, and the patient had a series of brown Steri-Strips and Aquaplast cast placed over the nasal dorsum.  The inner nasal area was then examined at the termination of the case and it seemed to be hemostatic as well.,The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  He was charged to home on antibiotics to prevent infection both from the left ear conchal cartilage harvest and also the Gore-Tex implant area.  He was asked to follow up in 4 days for removal of the bolster overlying the conchal cartilage harvest.","ent - otolaryngology, nasal deformity, rhinoplasty, conchal cartilage harvest, conchal bulb, conchal, submucoperichondrial, gull-wing incision, gore-tex, gull wing incision, lower lateral cartilages, revision rhinoplasty, nasal dorsum, cartilage harvest, conchal cartilage, cartilage, nasal, deformity, hemostasis, columella, harvest, cartilages"

The patient had a marked dorsal hump, which was both bony and cartilaginous in nature.,2.  The patient had marked hypertrophy of his nasalis muscle bilaterally contributing to the soft tissue dorsal hump.,3.  The patient had a C-shaped deformity to the left before he had tip ptosis.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who is status post blunt trauma to the nose approximately 9 months with the second episode 2 weeks following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity.  The patient was evaluated, but did not complain of nasal obstruction, and his main complaint was his cosmetic deformity.  He was found to have a C-shaped deformity to the left as well as some tip ptosis.  The patient was recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defect.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining a full consent from the patient, identified the patient, prepped with Betadine, brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  The appropriate Esmarch was placed; and after adequate sedation, the patient was subsequently intubated without difficulty.  The endotracheal tube was then secured, and the table was then turned clockwise to 90 degrees.  Three Afrin-soaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally.  The septum was then injected with 3 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally.  Then, 50 additional mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplasty.,Procedure was begun by first marking a columellar incision.  This incision was made using a #15 blade.  A lateral transfixion incision was then made bilaterally using a #15 blade, and then, the columellar incision was completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crura.  However, there was a dissection injury to the left medial crura.  Dissection was then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilages and then on to the upper lateral cartilage.  Once we reached the nasal bone, a Freer was used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion.  Once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structures, we appreciated a very large dorsal hump, which was made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portions.  There was also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage.  There was also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump.  The skin was contributing to the patient's cosmetic deformity.  In addition, we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage.  This mucocele was attempted to be dissected free, most of which was removed via dissection.  We then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a Rubin osteotome.  The dorsal hump was taken down and passed off the table.  Examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage.  This was passed off to use later for possible onlay grafts.  There was now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue.  A septoplasty was then performed throughout and a Kelly incision on the right side.  Subperichondrial planes were elevated on the right side, and then, a cartilage was incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side.  A 2 x 3-cm piece of the cardinal cartilage was then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut.  This cartilage was passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut grafts measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformities.  The spreader grafts were sewn in place using three interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally.  Once these were placed, we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof.  Lateral osteotomies were made with 2-mm osteotomes bilaterally.  The nasal bones were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity, and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum.  We then proceeded to the tip.  A cartilaginous strut was then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum.  It was approximately 15 mm long.  This was placed, and a pocket was just formed between the medial crura.  This pocket was taken down to the nasal spine, and then, the strut graft was placed.  The intradermal sutures were then placed using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition.  The intradermal sutures were then placed to help to align the nasal tip.  The cartilage strut was then sutured in place to the medial crura after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crura in the area of the plane suturing.  Prior to the intradermal suturing, the vestibular skin was also taken off in the area of the dome.,The columellar strut was then sutured in place using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot.  The patient had good tip support after this maneuver.  We then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the Rubin osteotome.  This was done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen, which is a radiated collagen.  The autogenous cartilage was wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion, and then, a 4-0 chromic suture was placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,The dorsal onlay was then sewn into position, and then, the 4-0 chromic suture was brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft.  Once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft, the graft was then sutured in place using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing sutures inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilages.  Once we were happy with the placement of this, we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally, and this was done using a #6 and then followed with a #3 push grafts.  This wrapping was performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,I went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformities as well as placement of the columellar strut, we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection; and therefore, we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon; and this was sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures.,At this point, we were happy with the test results, although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness.  There do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore, we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point.  The septum was reapproximated using a fast-absorbing 4-0 suture and a Keith needle placed in the mattress fashion.  The Kelly incision was closed using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing gut suture.  Doyle splints were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 3-0 monofilament suture.  The columellar skin was reapproximated using interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures, and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin was closed using interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures.,At the end of the procedure, all sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct.  A Denver external splint was then applied.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and transported to Anesthesia Care Unit in good condition.",

Nasal endoscopy.,2.  Partial rhinectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS: , This is an 81-year-old gentleman who underwent septorhinoplasty many years ago.  He also has a history of a skin lesion, which was removed from the nasal ala many years ago, the details of which he does not recall.  He has been complaining of tenderness and induration of his nasal tip for approximately two years and has been treated unsuccessfully for folliculitis and cellulitis of the nasal tip.  He was evaluated by Dr. A, who performed the septorhinoplasty, and underwent an intranasal biopsy, which showed histologic evidence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.  The preoperative examination shows induration of the nasal tip without significant erythema.  There is focal tenderness just cephalad to the alar crease.  There is no lesion either externally or intranasally.,PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  Following induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the left nose was decongested with Afrin.  He was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The left nasal cavity was examined by anterior rhinoscopy.  The septum was midline.  There was slight asymmetry of the nares.  No lesion was seen within the nasal cavity either in the area of the intercartilaginous area, which was biopsied by Dr. A, the septum, the lateral nasal wall, and the floor.  The 0-degree nasal endoscope was then used to examine the nasal cavity more completely.  No lesion was detectable.  A left intercartilaginous incision was made with a #15 blade since this was the area of previous biopsy by Dr. A.  The submucosal tissue was thickened diffusely, but there was no identifiable distinct or circumscribed lesion present.  Random biopsies of the submucosal tissue were taken and submitted to pathology for frozen section.  A diagnosis of diffuse invasive squamous cell carcinoma was rendered.  An alar incision was made with a #15 blade and the full-thickness incision was completed with the electrocautery.  The incision was carried more cephalad through the lower lateral cartilage up to the area of the upper lateral cartilage at the superior margin.  The full unit of the left nasal tip was excised completely and submitted to pathology after tagging and labeling it.  Frozen section examination again revealed diffuse squamous cell carcinoma throughout the soft tissues involving all margins.  Additional soft tissue was then taken from all margins tagging them for the pathologist.  The inferior margins were noted to be clear on the next frozen section report, but there was still disease present in the region of the upper lateral cartilage at its insertion with the nasal bone.  A Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum off the maxillary process and off the inferior aspect of the nasal bone.  Additional soft tissue was taken in these regions along the superior margin.  The frozen section examination revealed persistent disease medially and additional soft tissue was taken and submitted to pathology.  Once all margins had been cleared histologically, additional soft tissue was taken from the entire wound.  A 5-mm chisel was used to take down the inferior aspect of the nasal bone and the medial-most aspect of the maxilla.  This was all submitted to pathology for routine permanent examination.  Xeroform gauze was then fashioned to cover the defect and was sutured along the periphery of the wound with interrupted 6-0 nylon suture to provide a barrier and moisture.  The anesthetic was then discontinued as the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.","ent - otolaryngology, nasal cavity, joseph elevator, squamous cell carcinoma, endoscopy, intranasally, maxilla, nasal ala, nasal tip, rhinectomy, septorhinoplasty, nasal endoscopy, lateral cartilage, frozen section, additional soft, squamous cell, cell carcinoma, nasal, cartilage, squamous, carcinoma, cavity, tissue "

Open reduction of nasal septum and nasal pyramid fracture with osteotomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  Under affects of general endotracheal anesthesia, head and neck were prepped and draped with pHisoHex solution and draped in the appropriate sterile fashion.  A gull-wing incision was drawn over the forehead scalp.  Hair was removed along the suture line and incision was made to skin and subcutaneous tissue of the scalp down to, but not including the pericranium.  An inferiorly based forehead flap was then elevated to the superior orbital rim.  The depression of the anterior table of the frontal sinus was noted.  An incision was made more posterior creating an inferiorly based pericranial flap.  The supraorbital nerve was axing from the supraorbital foramen and the supraorbital foramen was converted to a groove in order to allow further inferior displacement and positioning of the forehead flap.  These allowed exposure of the medial orbital wall on the right side.  The displaced fractures of the right medial orbital wall were repositioned through coronal approach.  ,Further reduction of the nose intranasally also allowed the ethmoid fracture to be aligned more appropriately in the medial wall.  The anterior table fracture was satisfactorily reduced.  Multiple 1.3-mm screws and plate fixation were utilized to recontour the anterior forehead.  A mucocele was removed from the frontal sinus and there was no significant destruction of the posterior wall.  A sinus seeker was utilized and passed into the nasofrontal duct without difficulty.  It was felt that the frontal sinus obliteration would not be necessary.,At this point, the pericranial flap was folded in a fan-folded fashion on top of the plate and screw and hardware and fixed in position with the sutures to remain better contour of the forehead.  At this point, the nose was significantly shifted to the left and an open reduction of the nasal fracture was performed by osteotomies, which were made medially, laterally, and percutaneous transverse osteotomy of the nasal bone on the right side.  There is significant depression of the nasal bone on the left side.  A medial osteotomy was performed on the left side mobilizing nasal pyramid satisfactorily.  There is a high septal deviation, which would not allow complete correction of the deviation.  It was felt that this would best be left for a later date.  Open reduction rhinoplasty could be performed with spread of cartilage grafting in order to straighten the septum high dorsally.  Local infiltration anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the conjunctival fornix of the right lower eyelid as well as the inferior orbital rim.  An incision was made in the palpebral conjunctiva and capsular palpebral fascia beneath the tarsal plate preseptal approach to the inferior orbital rim was performed in this fashion.  Dissection proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim and subperiosteal dissection was performed over the orbital floor.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  There was entrapped periorbita, which was released to the fractures, which were repositioned, but not fixed in position.  The forced ductions were performed, which demonstrated release of the periorbit satisfactorily.  The conjunctival incision was closed with an interrupted simple 6-0 plain gut suture.  The nasal pyramid was satisfactorily mobilized as well as the nasal septum and brought back to midline position with the help of a Boies elevator for the septum.  The coronal incision was closed with interrupted 3-0 PDS suture for the galea and deep subcutaneous tissue and the skin closed with interrupted surgical staples.  Nose was dressed with Steri-Strips.  Mastisol Orthoplast splint was prepared after the Doyle splints were placed in the nose and secured with 3-0 Prolene suture and the nose packed with two Kennedy Merocel sponges.  A supportive mildly compressive dressing with fluffs, Kerlix, and 4-inch Ace were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition.","ent - otolaryngology, frontal sinus, nasal septal, transconjunctival, anterior table, ethmoid, ethmoid fracture, gull-wing incision, nasal airway obstruction, nasal pyramid, nasoorbital, osteotomy, phisohex, periorbita, depressed anterior table, nasal pyramid fracture, sinus fractures, inferior orbital, pyramid fracture, entrapped periorbita, orbital, fractures, nasal, frontal, forehead, sinus,"

Nasal obstruction secondary to deviated nasal septum.,2.  Bilateral turbinate hypertrophy.,PROCEDURE:,  Cosmetic rhinoplasty.  Request for cosmetic change in the external appearance of the nose.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old white female with longstanding nasal obstruction.  She also has concerns with regard to the external appearance of her nose and is requesting changes in the external appearance of her nose.  From her functional standpoint, she has severe left-sided nasal septal deviation with compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy.  From the aesthetic standpoint, the nose is over projected, lacks rotation, and has a large dorsal hump.  First we are going to straighten the nasal septum and reduce the size of the turbinates and then we will also take down the hump, rotate the tip of the nose, and de-project the nasal tip.  I explained to her the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications for postsurgical procedure.  She had her questions asked and answered and requested that we proceed with surgery as outlined above.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The face, head, and neck were sterilely prepped and draped.  The nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with a left hemitransfixion incision, which was brought down into the left intercartilaginous incision.  Right intercartilaginous incision was also made and the dorsum of the nose was elevated in the submucoperichondrial and subperiosteal plane.  Intact bilateral septomucoperichondrial flaps were elevated and a severe left-sided nasal septal deviation was corrected by detachment of the caudal nasal septum from the maxillary crest in a swinging door fashion and placing it back into the midline.  Posterior vomerine spur was divided superiorly and inferiorly and a large spur was removed.  Anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate was clamped, cut, and resected.  The upper lateral cartilages were divided from their attachments to the dorsal nasal septum and the cartilaginous septum was lowered by approximately 2 mm.  The bony hump of the nose was lowered with a straight osteotome by 4 mm.  Fading medial osteotomies were carried out and lateral osteotomies were then created in order to narrow the bony width of the nose.  The tip of the nose was then addressed via a retrograde dissection and removal of cephalic caudal semicircle cartilage medially at the tip.  The caudal septum was shortened by 2 mm in an angle in order to enhance rotation.  Medial crural footplates were reattached to the caudal nasal septum with a projection rotation control suture of #3-0 chromic.  The upper lateral cartilages were rejoined to the dorsal septum with a #4-0 plain gut suture.  No middle valves or bone grafts were necessary.  Intact mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture and Doyle nasal splints were placed on either side of the nasal septum.  The middle meatus was filled with Surgicel and Cortisporin otic and external Denver splint was applied with sterile tape and Mastisol.  Excellent aesthetic and functional results were thus obtained and the patient was awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room in good condition.","ent - otolaryngology, nasal obstruction, cosmetic, dorsal hump, endotracheal tube, hemitransfixion incision, hypertrophy, intercartilaginous, intercartilaginous incision, nasal septum, nasal tip, septomucoperichondrial, submucoperichondrial, subperiosteal, turbinate, vomerine, spur, nasal septal, nasal, rhinoplasty, septum, "

", ENT - Otolaryngology, Recurrent nasal obstruction ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Recurrent nasal obstruction.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 5-year-old male, who was last evaluated by Dr. F approximately one year ago for suspected nasal obstruction, possible sleep apnea.  Dr. F's assessment at that time was the patient not had sleep apnea and did not truly even seem to have allergic rhinitis.  All of his symptoms had resolved when he had seen Dr. F, so no surgical plan was made and no further followup was needed.  However, the patient reports again today with his mother that they are now having continued symptoms of nasal obstruction and questionable sleep changes.  Again, the mother gives a very confusing sleep history but it does not truly sound like the child is having apneic events that are obstructive in nature.  It sounds like he is snoring loudly and does have some nasal obstruction at nighttime.  He also is sniffing a lot through his nose.  He has been tried on some nasal steroids but they only use this on a p.r.n. basis about one or two days every month and we are unsure if that has even helped at all, probably not.

There is no middle ear effusion.,ORAL CAVITY:  The patient has 2+ tonsils bilaterally.  There are clearly nonobstructive.  His uvula is midline.,NECK:  No lymphadenopathy appreciated.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a 5-year-old male, who presents for repeat evaluation of a possible nasal obstruction, questionable sleep apnea.  Again, the mother gives a confusing sleep history but it does not really sound like he is having apneic events.  They deny any actual gasping events.  It sounds like true obstructive events.  He clearly has some symptoms at this point that would suggest possible allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinitis.  I think the most appropriate way to proceed would be to first try this child on a nasal corticosteroid and use it appropriately.  I have given them prescription for Nasacort Aqua one spray to each nostril twice a day.  I instructed them on correct way to use this and the importance to use it on a daily basis.  They may not see any benefit for several weeks.  I would like to evaluate him in six weeks to see how we are progressing.  If he continues to have problems, I think at that point we may consider performing a transnasal exam in the office to examine his adenoid bed and that would really be the only surgical option for this child.  He may also need an allergy evaluation at that point if he continues to have problems.  However, I would like to be fairly conservative in this child.  Should the mother still have concerns regarding his sleeping at our next visit or should his symptoms worsen (I did instruct her call us if it worsens), we may even need to pursue a sleep study just to settle that issue once and for all.  We will see him back in six weeks.","ent - otolaryngology, recurrent nasal obstruction, allergic rhinitis, apneic events, sleep apnea, nasal obstruction, nasal, apnea, allergic, obstruction, sleep, "

Chest x-ray showed a suboptimal inspiration, but no evidence of an acute process in the chest.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was admitted to the hospital and allowed a clear liquid diet.  Activity is as tolerates.  CBC with differential, blood culture, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, glucose, UA, and urine culture all were ordered.  Chest x-ray was ordered as well with 2 views to evaluate for a possible pneumonia.  Pulse oximetry checks were ordered every shift and as needed with O2 ordered per nasal cannula if O2 saturations were less that 94%.  Gave D5 and quarter of normal saline at 45 mL per hour, which was just slightly above maintenance rate to help with hydration.  He was given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis media and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturations drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lungs remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosols every 6 hours to help maintain good lung function.  The nurses were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He was doing clear liquids well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fevers but last fever was around 13:45 on the previous day.  At the time of exam, he had 100% oxygen saturations on room air with temperature of 99.3 degrees F. with clear lungs.  He was given additional dose of Rocephin when it was felt that it would be appropriate for him to be discharged that morning.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT DISCHARGE: , He was at 100% oxygen saturations on room air with no further dips at night.  He has become afebrile and was having no further increased work of breathing.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Bilateral otitis media.,2.  Fever.,PLAN:  ,Recommended discharge.

3729, A sample note on otitis media., ENT - Otolaryngology, Otitis Media ,"OTITIS MEDIA, is an infection of the middle ear space where the small bones and nerves of the ear connect to the eardrum on one side and the eustachian tube on the other.  The ear infection itself is not contagious but the respiratory infection preceding it is transmittable.  Otitis media is most often seen in infants and young children.  There are several causes including a viral or bacterial infection that spreads to the middle ear by way of the eustachian tubes, nasal allergy drainage blocking the sinuses or eustachian tubes, enlarged adenoids also blocking sinuses or eustachian tubes and eardrum rupture.  Many factors can increase the risk of an ear infection like recent upper respiratory tract illness, crowded living conditions, family history of ear infections, day care, smoking in household, altitude changes, cold weather and genetic factors.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Irritability.,*  Ear pain, fullness, hearing loss.,*  Infants may pull on ear.,*  Fever.,*  Vomiting.,*  Discharge from ear.,*  Diarrhea.,TREATMENT:,*  Diagnosis is by physical exam and otoscopic exam.  Sometimes fluid from the ear is cultured.,*  Pain relievers, like acetaminophen (Tylenol).  Infant pain relievers are available.,*  Decongestant to relieve symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.,*  Antibiotics when indicated for bacterial infection such as Amoxicillin or Zithromycin.  Finish ALL antibiotics as prescribed.  Do not stop the medication even if symptoms subside.,*  Avoid swimming until infection goes away.,*  Surgery is sometimes necessary to put in tubes through the eardrum to equalize pressure and drain fluids.,*  Surgery to remove adenoids if they are enlarged.,*  Reduce activity until symptoms subside.,Call doctor's office if symptoms do not improve within 2 days of treatment, and for convulsion, fever, ear swelling, dizziness, twitching facial muscles and severe headache.","ent - otolaryngology, ear, ear infection, otitis media, sinuses, drainage, ear pain, fullness, hearing loss, ear swelling, fever, bacterial infection, eustachian tubes, infection, eardrum, respiratory, otitis, media, eustachian, tubes,"

He now has evidence of lesion in the left mid neck and the left superior neck on ultrasound, which are suspicious for recurrent cancer.  Left neck dissection is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was placed in an extended fashion.  The left neck, chest, and face were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hockey stick skin incision was performed, extending a previous incision line superiorly towards the mastoid cortex through skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma with Bovie electrocautery on cut mode.  Subplatysmal superior and inferior flaps were raised.  The dissection was left lateral neck dissection encompassing zones 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and the superior portion of 4.  The sternocleidomastoid muscle was unwrapped at its fascial attachment and this was taken back posterior to the XI cranial nerve into the superior posterior most triangle of the neck.  This was carried forward off of the deep rooted muscles including the splenius capitis and anterior and middle scalenes taken medially off of these muscles including the fascia of the muscles, stripped from the carotid artery, the X cranial nerve, the internal jugular vein and then carried anteriorly to the lateral most extent of the dissection previously done by Dr. X in the paratracheal region.

The patient is status post resection of the dorsal nasal sidewall skin cancer with nasolabial flap reconstruction with subsequent deformity.  In particular, the patient has had effacement of his alar crease with deepening of his nasolabial fold and notable asymmetry.  The patient was seen in consultation and felt to be a surgical candidate for improvement.  Risks and benefits of the operation were described to the patient in detail including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, scarring, possible damage to surrounding structures including neurovascular structures, need for revision of surgery, continued asymmetry, and anesthetic complication.  The patient understood these risks and benefits and consented to the operation.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to OR and placed supine on the operating table.  Dose of antibiotics was given to the patient.  Compression devices were placed on the lower extremities to prevent the knee embolic events.  The patient was turned to 180 degrees.  The ETT tube was secured and the area was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A head wrap was then placed on the position and we then began our local.  Of note, the patient had previous incisions just lateral to his lateral canthus bilaterally and that were used for access.  Local consisting a 50:50 mix of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was then injected into the subperiosteal plane taking care to prevent injury to the infraorbital nerves.  This was done bilaterally.  We then marked the nasolabial fold and began with the elevation of the left midface.,We began with a lateral canthal-type incision extending out over his previous incision down to subcutaneous tissue.  We continued down to the lateral orbital rim until we identified periosteum.  We then pulled in a periosteal elevator and elevated the midface down over the zygoma elevating some lateral mesenteric attachments down over the buccal region until we felt we had reached pass the nasolabial folds medially.  Care was taken to preserve the infraorbital nerve and that was visualized after elevation.  We then released the periosteum distally and retracted up on the periosteum and noted improved contour of the nasolabial fold with increased bulk over the midface region over the zygoma.,We then used our Endotine Coapt device to engage the periosteum at the desired location and then elevated the midface and secured into position using the Coapt bioabsorbable screw.  After this was then carried out, we then clipped and cut as well as the end of the screw.  Satisfied with this, we then elevated the periosteum and secured it to reinforce our midface elevation to the lateral orbital rim and this was done using 3-0 Monocryl.  Several sutures were then used to anchor the orbicularis and deeper tissue to create additional symmetry.  Excess skin along the incision was then removed as well the skin from just lateral to the canthus.  Care was taken to leave the orbicularis muscle down.  We then continued closing our incision using absorbable plain gut 5-0 sutures for the subciliary-type incision and then continuing with interrupted 6-0 Prolenes lateral to the canthus.,We then turned our attention to performing the z-plasty portion of the case.  A z-plasty was designed along the previous scar where it was padding to the notable scar deformity and effacement of crease and the z-plasty was then designed to lengthen along the scar to improve the contour.  This was carried out using a 15 blade down to subcutaneous tissue.  The flaps were debulked slightly to reduce the amount of fullness and then transposed and sutured into place using chromic suture.  At this point, we then noted that he had improvement of the nasal fold but continued asymmetry with regards to improved bulk on the left side and less bulk on the right and it was felt that a symmetrization procedure was required to make more symmetry with the midface bilaterally and nasolabial folds bilaterally.  As such, we then carried out the dissection after injecting local as noted and we used a 15 blade scalpel to create our incision along the lateral canthus along its preexisting incision.  We carried this down to the lateral orbital rim again elevating the periosteum taking care to preserve infraorbital nerve.,At this point, we then released the periosteum distally just at the level of the nasolabial fold and placed our Endotine midface implant into the desired area and then elevated slightly just for symmetry only.  This was then secured in place using the bioabsorbable screw and then resected a very marginal amount of tissue just for removal of the dog ear deformity and closed the deeper layers of tissue using 3-0 PDS and then closing the extension to the subciliary area using 5-0 plain gut and then 6-0 Prolene lateral to the canthus.,At this point, we felt that we had achieved improved contour, improved symmetry, and decreased effacement of the nasolabial fold and alar crease.  Satisfied with our procedures, we then placed cool compresses on to the eyes.,The patient was then extubated and brought to the PACU in stable condition.,Dr. X was present and scrubbed for the entire case and actively participated during all key elements.

He also has persistent tonsillitis with hypertrophy and tonsillolith and halitosis.  He also has developed tremendous edema to his posterior palate and uvula, which is causing choking.  Correction of these mechanical abnormalities is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the right and left nasal septal mucosa and right and left inferior turbinates were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine using approximately 10 mL.  Afrin-soaked pledgets were placed in the nasal cavity bilaterally.  The face was prepped with pHisoHex and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hemitransfixion incision was performed on the left with a #15 blade and submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  Anterior to the septal deflection, the septal cartilage was incised and an opposite-sided submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  The deviated portion of the nasal septal cartilage and bone was removed with a Takahashi forceps, and a large inferior septal spur was removed with a V-chisel.  Once the septum was reduced in the midline, the hemitransfixion incision was closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion.  The right and left inferior turbinates were trimmed in a submucous fashion using straight and curved turbinate scissors under direct visualization with a 4 mm 0 degree Storz endoscope.  Hemostasis was acquired by using suction electrocautery.  The turbinates were then covered with bacitracin ointment after cauterizing them and bacitracin ointment soaked Doyle splints were placed in the right and left nares and secured anteriorly to the columella with a 3-0 nylon suture.  The table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was draped in a clean fashion.  A McIvor mouth gag was applied.  The tongue was retracted and the McIvor was gently suspended from the Mayo stand.  The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using a Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The right tonsil was grasped in a similar fashion, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The inferior, middle, and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery.  The extremely edematous portion of soft palate was resected using a right angle clamp and right angle scissor and was closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight interrupted fashion.  Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed.  There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL.

On physical examination, she was derived to have a severely deviated septum with an S-shape deformity as well as turbinate hypertrophy present along the inferior turbinates contributing to the obstruction.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operating Suite where she was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away.  Nasal pledgets saturated with 4 cc of 10% cocaine solution were inserted into the nasal cavities.  These were then removed and the nasal septum as well as the turbinates were localized with the mixture of 1% lidocaine with 1:100000 epinephrine solution.  The nasal pledgets were then reinserted as the patient was prepped in the usual fashion.  The nasal pledgets were again removed and the turbinates as well as an infraorbital nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine solution.  The nasal vestibules were then cleansed with a pHisoHex solution.  A #15 blade scalpel was then used to make an incision along the length of the caudal septum.  The mucoperichondrial junction was then identified with the aid of cotton-tipped applicator as well as the stitch scissor.  Once the plane was identified, the mucosal flap on the left side of the septum was elevated with the aid of a Cottle.  At this point it should be mentioned that the patient's septum was significantly deviated with a large S-shape deformity obstructing both the right and left nasal cavity with the convex portion present in the left nasal cavity.  Again, the Cottle elevator was used to raise the mucosal flap down to the level of the septal spur.  At this point, the septal knife was used to make a crossover incision through the cartilage just anterior to the septal spur.  Again, the mucosal flap was elevated in the right nasal septum.  Now Knight scissors were used to remove the ascending portion of the nasal cartilage, which was then removed with a Takahashi forceps.  A Cottle elevator was used to further elevate the mucosal flap off the septal spur on the left side.  Removal of the spur was performed with the aid of the septal knife as well as a 3 mm straight chisel.  Once all ascending cartilage has been removed, inspection of the nasal cavity revealed patent passages with the exception of inferior turbinates that were very hypertrophied and was felt to be contributing to the patient's symptoms.  Therefore, the turbinates were again localized and a #15 blade scalpel was used to make a vertical incision dissected down to the chondral bone.  The XPS microdebrider with the inferior turbinate blade was then inserted through the incision and a submucous resection was performed by passing the microdebrider along the length of the bone.  Once the submucosal tissue had been resected, an outfracture procedure was performed so as to fully open the nasal passages.  Inspection revealed very patent and nonobstructive nasal passages.  Now the caudal incision was reapproximated with #4-0 chromic suture.  Finally, a #4-0 fast absorbing plain gut suture was used to approximate the mucosal surface of the septum in a running whipstitch fashion.  Finally, Merocel packing was placed and the patient was retuned to the Department of Anesthesia for awakening and taken to the recovery room without incident.","ent - otolaryngology, chronic nasal obstruction, nasal septum, inferior turbinate hypertrophy, nasal septal reconstruction, submucous resection, inferior turbinates, outfracture, nasal septal, nasal pledgets, nasal cavity, nasal obstruction, turbinate hypertrophy, mucosal flap, septal, septum, turbinates, nasal, cavity, chronic, hypertrophy, obstruction, mucosal,"

It was unclear from her previous operative records and CT scan as to whether or not she was a reconstruction candidate.  She had reports of stapes fixation as well as otosclerosis on her CT scan.,At surgery, she was found to have a mobile malleus handle, but her stapes was fixed by otosclerosis.  There was no incus.  There was no specific round window niche.  There was a very minute crevice; however, exploration of this area did not reveal a niche to a round window membrane.  The patient had a type of TORP prosthesis, which had tilted off the footplate anteriorly underneath the malleus handle.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative room and placed in supine position.  The right face, ear, and neck prepped with ***** alcohol solution.  The right ear was draped in the sterile field.  External auditory canal was injected with 1% Xylocaine with 1:50,000 epinephrine.  A Fisch indwelling incision was made and a tympanomeatal flap was developed in a 12 o'clock to the 7 o'clock position.  Meatal skin was elevated, middle ear was entered.  This exposure included the oval window, round window areas.  There was a good cartilage graft in place and incorporated into the posterior superior ***** of the drum.  The previous prosthesis was found out of position as it had tilted out of position anteriorly, and there was no contact with the footplate.  The prosthesis was removed without difficulty.  The patient's stapes had an arch, but the ***** was atrophied.  Malleus handle was mobile.  The footplate was fixed.  Consideration have been given to performing a stapedectomy with a tissue seal and then returning later for prosthesis insertion; however, upon inspection of the round window area, there was found to be no definable round window niche, no round window membrane.  The patient was felt to have obliterated otosclerosis of this area along with the stapes fixation.  She is not considered to be a reconstruction candidate under the current circumstances.  No attempt was made to remove bone from the round window area.  A different style of Goldenberg TORP was placed on the footplate underneath the cartilage support in hopes of transferring some sound conduction from the tympanic membrane to the footplate.  The fit was secure and supported with Gelfoam in the middle ear.  The tympanomeatal flap was returned to anatomic position supported with Gelfoam saturated Ciprodex.

Fullness in right base of the tongue.,2.  Chronic right ear otalgia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Pending pathology.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Microsuspension direct laryngoscopy with biopsy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION:,  This is a 50-year-old female who presents to the office with a chief complaint of ear pain on the right side.  Exact etiology of her ear pain had not been identified.  A fiberoptic examination had been performed in the office.  Upon examination, she was noted to have fullness in the right base of her tongue.  She was counseled on the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery and consented to such.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Operative Suite where she was placed in supine position.  General endotracheal tube intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away where a shoulder roll was placed.  A tooth guard was then placed to protect the upper dentition.  The Dedo laryngoscope was then inserted into the oral cavity.  It was advanced on the right lateral pharyngeal wall until the epiglottis was brought into view.  At this point, it was advanced underneath the epiglottis until the vocal cords were seen.  At this point, it was suspended via the Lewy suspension arm from the Mayo stand.  At this point, the Zeiss microscope with a 400 mm lens was brought into the surgical field.  Inspection of the vocal cords underneath the microscope revealed them to be white and glistening without any mucosal abnormalities.  It should be mentioned that the right vocal cord did appear to be slightly more hyperemic, however, there were no mucosal abnormalities identified.  This was confirmed with a laryngeal probe as well as use of mirror evaluated in the subglottic portion as well as the ventricle.  At this point, the scope was desuspended and the microscope was removed.  The scope was withdrawn through the vallecular region.  Inspection of the vallecula revealed a fullness on the right side with a papillomatous type growth that appeared very friable.  Biopsies were obtained with straight-biting cup forceps.  Once hemostasis was achieved, the scope was advanced into the piriform sinuses.  Again in the right piriform sinus, there was noted to be studding along the right lateral wall of the piriform sinus.  Again, biopsies were performed and once hemostasis was achieved, the scope was further withdrawn down the lateral pharyngeal wall.  There were no mucosal abnormalities identified within the oropharynx.  The scope was then completely removed and a bimanual examination was performed.  No neck masses were identified.  At this point, the procedure was complete.  The mouth guard was removed and the patient was returned to Anesthesia for awakening and taken to the recovery room without incident.","ent - otolaryngology, microsuspension, laryngoscopy, otalgia, ear pain, fiberoptic, dedo laryngoscope, epiglottis, direct laryngoscopy, piriform sinuses, tongue, microscope, mucosal, abnormalities, fullness, ear, scope "

He has a left nasal obstruction and depressed left nasal bone.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was given general endotracheal anesthesia and monitored with pulse oximetry, EKG, and CO2 monitors.,The face was prepped with Betadine soap and solution and draped in a sterile fashion.  Nasal mucosa was decongested using Afrin pledgets as well as 1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into bilateral nasal septal mucoperichondrium and the nasal dorsum, lateral osteotomy sites.,Inspection revealed caudal portion of the cartilaginous septum lying crosswise across the nasal spine area and columella causing obstruction of the left nasal valve.  Further up, the cartilaginous septum was displaced to the left of the maxillary crest.  There was a large maxillary crest and supramaxillary crest had a large spur with the vomer bone touching the inferior turbinate.,There was a large deep groove horizontally on the right side corresponding to the left maxillary crest.,A left hemitransfixion incision was made.  Mucoperichondrium was elevated from left side of the cartilaginous septum and mucoperiosteum was elevated from the ethmoid plate.  Vomer and inferior tunnel was created at the floor of the left side of the nose to connect the anterior and inferior tunnels, which was rather difficult at the area of the vomerine spur, which was very sharp and touching the inferior turbinate.,The caudal cartilaginous septum, which was lying crosswise, was separated from the main cartilage leaving approximately 1 cm strut.  The right side mucoperichondrium was released from the cartilaginous septum as well as ethmoid plate and the maxillary crest area.,The caudal cartilaginous strut was sutured to the columella with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut suture to bring it into the midline.,Further back, the cartilaginous septum anterior to the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side, so it was freed from the maxillary crest, nasal dorsum, from the ethmoid plate, and was sutured in the midline with a transfixion #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,Further posteriorly, the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side and portion of it was removed with Jansen-Middleton punch forceps.,The main deviation was also caused by the vomerine crest and the maxillary crest and supramaxillary cartilaginous cartilage.,This area was freed from the perichondrium on both sides.  The maxillary crest was removed with a gouge.  Vomer was partially removed with a gouge and the rest of the vomer was displaced back into the midline.,Thus, the deviated septum was corrected.  Left hemitransfixion incisions were closed with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The septum was also filtered with #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,By valve, septal splints were tied to the septum bilaterally with a transfixion #5-0 nylon suture.,Next, the nasal bone suture deviated to the left side were corrected.  The right nasal bone was depressed and left nasal bone was wide.  Therefore, the nasal bones were refractured back into the midline by compressing the left nasal bone and elevating the right nasal bone with the nasal bone elevator through the nasal cavities.  The left intercartilaginous incision was made and the nasal bones were disimpacted subperiosteally and they were molded back into the midline.,Steri-Strips were applied to the nasal dorsal skin and a Denver type of splint was applied to the nasal dorsal to stabilize the nasal bones.,Nasal cavities were packed with Telfa gauze rolled on both sides with bacitracin ointment.  Approximate blood loss was 10 to 20 mL.","ent - otolaryngology, nasal fracture, deviated nasal septum, nasal septoplasty, nasal bones, ethmoid plate, cartilaginous septum, nasal bone, maxillary crest, septum, nasal, fracture, maxillary, cartilaginous, crest, "

After this, the patient was placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the operative table was turned 90 degrees by the Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed followed by the patient being placed in reverse Trendelenburg.,After this, a mouthguard was placed in the upper teeth and a Dedo laryngoscope was placed in the patient's oral cavity and advanced through the oral cavity in the oropharynx down into the hypopharynx.  The patient's larynx was then brought into view with the true vocal cords hidden underneath what appeared to be redundant false vocal cords.  The left true vocal cord was then first addressed and appeared to have an extensive area of leukoplakia extending from the posterior one-third up to the anterior third.  The false vocal cord also appeared to be very full on the left side along with fullness in the subglottic region.  The patient's anterior commissure appeared to be clear.  The false cord on the right side also appeared to be very redundant and overshadowing the true vocal cord.  Once the true vocal cord was retracted laterally, there was revealed a second area of leukoplakia involving the right true vocal cord in the anterior one-third aspect.  The patient's subglottic region was very edematous and with redundant mucosal tissue.  The areas of leukoplakia appeared to be cobblestoned in appearance, irregularly bordered, and very hard to the touch.  The left true vocal cord was then first addressed, was stripped from posteriorly to anteriorly utilizing a #45 laryngeal forceps.  After this, the patient had pressure placed upon this area with tropical adrenaline and a rectal swab to maintain hemostasis.  The specimen was passed off the field and was sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Hemostasis was maintained on the left side.

Total laryngectomy, right level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection, tracheoesophageal puncture, cricopharyngeal myotomy, right thyroid lobectomy.", ENT - Otolaryngology, Laryngectomy & Thyroid Lobectomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Total laryngectomy, right level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection, tracheoesophageal puncture, cricopharyngeal myotomy, right thyroid lobectomy.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , A 58-year-old gentleman who has had a history of a T3 squamous cell carcinoma of his glottic larynx having elected to undergo a laser excision procedure in late 06/07.  Subsequently, biopsy confirmed tumor persistence in the right glottic region.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgical intervention versus possibility of chemoradiation therapy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Also concerned for a CT scan finding of possible cartilaginous invasion at the cricoid level.  The patient understood the issues regarding surgical intervention and wished to undergo a surgical intervention despite a clear understanding of risks, benefits, and alternatives.  He was accompanied by his wife and daughter.  Risks included, but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury of the nerves including lower lip weakness, tongue weakness, tongue numbness, shoulder weakness, need for physical therapy, possibility of total laryngectomy, possibility of inability to speak or swallow, difficulty eating, wound care issues, failure to heal, need for additional treatment, and the patient understood all of these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  After the establishment of the general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation, the patient had his eyes protected with Tegaderm.  A #6 endotracheal tube was placed initially.  Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Lindholm laryngoscope.  A 0-degree endoscope was used to take pictures of what was apparently a recurrence of tumor along the right true vocal fold extending into the anterior arytenoid area and extending about 1 cm below into the subglottis.  Subsequently, a decision was then made to go ahead and perform the surgical intervention.  A hemi-apron incision was employed, and 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied after the patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, a hemi-apron incision was performed.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised at the hyoid bone into the clavicle.  Attention was then turned to the right side, where a level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection was performed.  Submandibular fascia was appreciated inferiorly along the submandibular gland, this was incised allowing for identification of the digastric muscle.  Digastric tunnel was performed posteriorly to the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia along the sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected along the anterior aspect until the cranial nerve XI was identified.  Level 2A contents were then dissected off the floor of the neck including levels 3 and 4.  Preservation of the phrenic nerve was obtained by identification, and subsequently cross-clamping fibrofatty tissue and lymph nodes just adjacent to the jugular vein inferiorly at level 4.  The specimen was then mobilized over the internal jugular vein with preservation of hypoglossal nerve.  Levels 2, 3, 4 neck dissection specimens were then labeled appropriately, attached with staples, and sent for histopathological evaluation.,Attention was then turned to attempting to perform a partial laryngectomy up front with a possibility of total laryngectomy as discussed.  Subsequently, the strap muscles were separated in the midline.  The trachea was identified in the midline.  The thyroid isthmus was plicated using the Harmonic scalpel, and attention was then turned to transecting the strap muscles at the superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage.  Once this was performed, sinuses were mobilized from the thyroid cartilage both on the right and left side respectively.  The cricothyroid joint was then freed on the left side and then on the right side with noting on the right side that this cartilage was a bit more irregular.  Attention was then turned to performing a cricothyrotomy.  Upon performing this, it was obvious that there was tumor just above the level of the cricothyrotomy incision.  A #7 anode tube was then placed in this area and secured.  Attention was then turned to performing the laryngotomy at the level of the petiole of epiglottis.  Subsequently, the cuts were made on the left side with visualization of the vocalis process and coming down to the level of the cricoid cartilage, and the thyroid cartilage was then intentionally fractured along the anterior spine.  It was evident that this tumor had extended more than 1 cm into the subglottic region.  Careful dissection of larynx from an inferior margin and portion of cricoid cartilage resection then was performed posteriorly, though it was evident that the cricoid cartilage was invaded.  Frozen section biopsy then confirmed this finding as read by Dr. X of Surgical Pathology.,In light of this finding with cartilaginous invasion and inability to preserve the cricoid cartilage, the patient's case was then converted into a total laryngectomy.  Subsequently, the trachea was transected at the level 3, 4 tracheal ring into cartilaginous space and anterior tracheal stoma was fashioned using 3-0 vertical mattress sutures for the skin.  A W-plasty was also performed to allow for enlargement of the stoma.  Attention was then turned to identifying the common parting wall of the trachea and the esophagus.  Attention was then turned to resecting the hyoid bone.  The remainder of the specimen cuts were made superior from sinus preserving a modest amount of pharyngeal mechanism.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Subsequently, a tracheoesophageal puncture site was performed using a right-angled hemostat at about approximately 1 cm from the posterior tracheal wall superior aspect.  Once this was performed, a running 3-0 canal stitch was used to close the pharynx.  Subsequently, interrupted 4-0 chromic stitches were then used as reinforcement line from superior to inferior, and fibrin glue was applied.  Two #10 JP drains were placed on the right side and one on the left side and secured appropriately with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was then closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for the platysma and staples for the skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the Weinberg Intensive Care Unit with the endotracheal tube still in place to be decannulated later.","ent - otolaryngology, laryngectomy, neck dissection, tracheoesophageal, cricopharyngeal myotomy, thyroid lobectomy, squamous cell carcinoma, larynx, thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, total laryngectomy, thyroid, cartilage"

Bilateral nasal polypectomy.,5.  Right middle turbinate reduction.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal tube.,BLOOD LOSS:,  Approximately 50 cc.,INDICATION: , This is a 48-year-old female with a history of chronic sinusitis as well as nasal polyposis that have been refractory to outpatient medical management.  She has underwent sinus surgery in the past approximately 12 years ago with the CT evaluation revealed evidence of chronic mucosal thickening within the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses as well as the presence of polyposis within the nasal cavities bilaterally.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the operative suite where she was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away where cotton pledgets saturated with 4 cc of 10% cocaine solution were inserted into the nasal cavity.  The nasal septum, as well as the turbinates were then localized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,Attention was directed first to the left nasal cavity.  A zero-degree sinus endoscope was inserted into the nasal cavity down to the level of the nasopharynx.  The initial examination revealed a gross polypoid disease emanating from the sphenoid sinuses as well as off the supreme turbinate.  There was also polypoid disease present within the left middle meatus.  Nasopharynx was visualized with a patent eustachian tube.  At this point, the XPS micro debrider was used to take down all the polyps emanating from the inferior surface of the left middle turbinate as well as from the supreme turbinate.  The ostium to the sphenoid sinus was visualized and was not entered.  At this point, the left middle turbinate was localized and then medialized with the use of a freer elevator.  A ball-tip probe was then used to localize the openings for the natural maxillary ostium.  Side-biting forceps were used to take down the uncinate process and was further taken down with the use of the microdebrider.  The opening of the maxillary sinus was visualized.  The posterior fontanelle was taken down with the use of straight line forceps.  It should be mentioned that tissue was very thick and polypoid with chronic inflammatory changes evident.  The maxillary sinus ostia was then suctioned with Olive-tip suction and maxillary wash was performed.  The remainder of the anterior ethmoid was then cleaned again removing excess polypoid tissue.  The basal lamella was visualized and the posterior ethmoid air cells were then entered with use of the microdebrider as the surgical assistant palpated the patient's eyes for any vibration.  All polypoid tissue was collected in the microdebrider and sent as a surgical specimen.  Once all polypoid tissue has been removed, the cocaine pledgets were reinserted into the ethmoid air cells for hemostatic purposes.  Attention was then directed to the right nasal cavity.  Again, a sinus endoscope was inserted.  Inspection revealed a grossly hypertrophied turbinate.  It was felt that this enlarged and polypoid turbinate was contributing the patient's symptoms.  Therefore, the turbinate was localized and a hemostat was used to crush the mid portion of the turbinate, which was then resected with use of side-biting scissors as well the Takahashi forceps.  Sinus endoscope was then inserted all the way down through the nasopharynx.  Again, the eustachian tube was visualized without any obstructing lesions or masses.  Upon retraction, there was again polypoid tissue noted within the ethmoid sinuses.  The ball-tip probe was again used to locate the right maxillary ostium.  The side-biting forceps was used further take down the uncinate process.  The maxillary ostium was then widened with use of a XPS microdebrider.  A maxillary sinus wash was then performed.  Now, the attention was directed to the ethmoid air cells.  It should be mentioned again that the tissue of the anterior ethmoid was very thickened and polypoid.  This was again taken down with the use of XPS microdebrider while the surgical assistant carefully palpated the patient's eye.,Once all polypoid tissue have been removed, some bleeding that was encountered was controlled with the use of suction cautery in a very conservative manner.  Once all bleeding has been controlled, all surgical instruments were removed and Merocel packing was placed in the bilateral nasal cavities with the intent to remove in the recovery room.  At this point, the procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room without incident.","ent - otolaryngology, endoscopic sinus surgery, maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, nasal polypectomy, turbinate reduction, sinus surgery, sinus endoscope, maxillary sinus, nasal cavity, polypoid tissue, sinus, maxillary, turbinate, polypoid, nasal, total, ostium, microdebrider,"

After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the skin was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the region of the anterior portion of the nasal septum.  Approximately 10 cc total was used.,A #15 blade and the Freer elevator were used to help make a standard hemitransfixion incision.  A mucoperichondrial flap was carefully elevated, and the junction with the cartilaginous bony septum was separated with the Freer elevator.  The bony deflection was removed using Jansen-Middleton forceps.  The cartilaginous deflection was created by freeing up the inferior attachments to the cartilaginous septum, placing it more on the midline maxillary crest.  The initial incision was placed in its anatomical position and secured with a 4-0 nylon suture for stabilization effect.,Attention then was directed toward the left side.  Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected in the region of the anterior portion of the left middle turbinate and uncinate process and polyps.  Approximately 10 cc total was used.  The polyps were removed using the Richards essential shaver to help identify the middle turbinate and uncinate process better.  The uncinate process was removed systematically superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting forceps.  Next, the maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting forceps and showed polypoid accumulation in the mucosal disease on its opening site.  The sinus linings were edematous but did not have any polyps in the inferior, lateral, or superior aspects.,The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were entered primarily and dissected with the Richards essential shaver followed by the use of a 30-degree endoscope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral dissection.  Bright mucosal disease and small polypoid accumulations were noted through the sinuses also.  The inferior turbinates had some polypoid changes on them also and showed marked mucosal irritation and hypertrophy.  The mucosal polypoid accumulations were cleared using the Richards essential shaver.  The turbinate was partially resected from mucosally but with good shape to it.  It was not desirable to remove it in its entirety.  Any obvious bleeding points along the edge were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.,The same procedure and findings were noted on the right side with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine injected into the anterior portion of the right middle turbinate, polyps, and uncinate process; 10 cc total were used.  The polyps were removed.  The Richards essential shaver was used to allow better exposure of the uncinate process.  The uncinate process was removed superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting side-biting forceps.,Next, a maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting and side-biting forceps and showed all plate accumulations there also.  The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were then entered primarily and dissected with Richards essential shaver followed by the use of the 30-degree scope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral resection.  The inferior turbinates showed mucosal disease, polypoid accumulations, and changes.  These were removed using the Richards essential shaver followed by a submucosal resection of the hypertrophied portion of the turbinate.,Any obvious bleeding points were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.  A thorough irrigation was then carried out in the nasal cavity, and Gelfilm packing was used to coat the linings in the middle meatal regions.

I anticipate this patient may need several days of IV antibiotics and then be able to switch over to oral.  I do not insist that this patient will need surgical intervention since there is no evidence of abscess.  This one episode of severe tonsillitis does not mean the patient needs tonsillectomy, but if he continues to have significant tonsil problems after this he should be referred for ENT evaluation as an outpatient.  The patient's parents in the room had expressed good understanding, have a chance to ask questions.  At this time, I will see the patient back on an as needed basis.",

We discussed with the patient the indications, risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the proposed surgical procedure, she had her questions asked and answered.  Preoperative imaging was performed in consultation with regard to aesthetic results and communicated via the computerized imager.  The patient had questions asked and answered.  Informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The patient was converted to the lounge chair position, and the nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with an inverted going incision and elevation of the skin of the nose in the submucoperichondrial plane over the medial crural footplates and lower lateral cartilages and up over the dorsum.  The septal angle was approached and submucoperichondrial flaps were elevated.  Severe nasal septal deviation to the right hand side and evidence of an old fracture with a separate alignment of the cartilaginous nose from the bony nose was encountered.  The upper laterals were divided and medial and lateral osteotomies were carried out.  Inadequate septal cartilage was noted to be present for use as spreader graft; therefore, left postauricular incision was made, and the conchal bowl cartilage graft was harvested, and it was closed with 3-0 running locking chromic with a sterile cotton ball pressure dressing applied.  Ear cartilage graft was then placed to put two spreader grafts on the left and one the right.  The two on the left extended all the way up to the caudal tip, the one on the right just primarily the medial wall.  It was placed in such a way to correct a caudal dorsal deviation of the nasal tip septum.  The upper lateral cartilage was noted to be of the same width and length in size.  Yet, the left lower cartilage was scarred and adherent to the upper lateral cartilage.  The upper lateral cartilages were noted to be excessive of uneven length with the right being much taller than the left and that was shortened to the same length.  The scar bands were released in the lower lateral cartilages to the upper lateral cartilages to allow free mobilization of the lower lateral cartilages.  A middle crus stitch was used to unite the domes, and then the nose was projected by suturing the medial crural footplates of the caudal septum in deep projected fashion.  Crushed ear cartilage was then placed in the pockets above the spreader grafts in the area of the deficient dorsal nasal height and the lateral nasal sidewall height.  The spreader brought an excellent aesthetic appearance to the nose.  We left more than 1 cm of dorsal and caudal support for the nasal tip and dorsum height.  Mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture.  The skin was closed with 5-0 chromic and 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed on each side of nasal septum and secured with 3-0 nylon and a Denver splint was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.","ent - otolaryngology, nasal deformity, nasal obstruction, nasal valve, cartilage, cartilaginous, crural, graft, nasal fracture, postauricular, rhinoplasty, septal cartilage, submucoperichondrial, turbinectomy, vestibular, ear cartilage graft, posttraumatic nasal deformity, vestibular stenosis, ear cartilage, cartilage graft, cartilages, caudal, nasal, nose, obstruction, repair, stenosis"

The left ear laceration deformity was very close to the bottom of her ear and therefore it was transected through the centrifugal edge of the ear lobe and pared.  The marsupialized epithelialized tracts were pared to raw tissue.  They were pared in a fashion to create a Y-V plasty with de-epithelialization of the distal V and overlap of the undermined from the proximal cephalad edge.  The 5-0 chromic sutures were used to approximate anteriorly, posteriorly, and anterior centrifugal edge in the Y-V plasty fashion to decrease the risk of notching.  Bacitracin, Band-Aid was placed.  Next, attention was turned to the contralateral ear where an elongated laceration deformity was pared of the marsupialized epithelialized edges anteriorly, posteriorly to create raw edges.  This was not taken through the edge of the lobe to decrease the risk of notch deformity.  The laceration was repaired anteriorly and posteriorly in a pleated fashion to decrease length of the incision and to decrease any deformity toward the edge or any dog-ear deformity toward the edge.  The 5-0 chromic sutures were used in interrupted fashion for this.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Band-Aid and bacitracin were placed.

Vaginal delivery was uneventful with a normal perinatal course.  Patient sat alone at 6 months, crawled at 9 months, and walked at 13 months.  His verbal and motor developmental milestones were as expected.,FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: , Patient lives with both parents and two siblings (brother - age 11 years, sister - age 15 years).  He reports enjoying school, remains active in scouts, and is very excited about being on the wresting team.  Mom reports that he has several friends, but she is concerned about the time required for the wrestling team.  Patient is in 8th grade this year and an A/B student.  Both siblings are healthy.  His Dad has hypertension and has frequent heartburn symptoms that he treats with over-the-counter (OTC) medications.  Mom is healthy and has asthma.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Patient has been seen in the clinic yearly for well child exams.  He has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations.  He had one emergency room visit 2 years ago for a knee laceration.  Patient has been healthy except for the past year when he had two episodes of otitis media not associated with respiratory infections.  He received antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) for the otitis media and both episodes resolved without problems.  Patient's Mom states that he takes no prescribed medications or OTC medications, but he admits that he has been taking his dad's OTC Pepcid AE sometimes when he gets heartburn.  Upon further examination, he reports taking Pepcid when he eats pizza or Mexican food.  He does complain of sore throats sometimes and often feels burning in his throat when he goes to sleep at night after a late evening snack.,NUTRITIONAL HISTORY: , Patient eats cereal bars or pop tarts with milk for breakfast most days.

It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.,PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.,  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility, particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.,GERD.,  The history of ""heartburn"" relieved by his father's medication was striking.  The positive study supported the diagnosis of GERD, which was severe and chronic enough to cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces exposed to the gastric juices and edema, inflammation in the inner ears.,PLAN:,  Patient and his Mom agreed to a trial of omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks.  Patient was to keep a diary of any episodes of heartburn, including what foods seemed to aggravate it.  The clinician asked him to avoid using any antacid products in the meantime to gage the effectiveness of the medication.  He was also given a prescription for 10 days of Augmentin99 and a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.  At his follow-up appointment he reported one episode after he ate a whole large pizza after wrestling practice but said it went away pretty quickly after he took his medication.  A 6-month follow up appointment was scheduled.",

Then, an incision was made just below the knee where the greater saphenous vein was also found and connection to varices from the calf were seen.  A third incision was made in the distal third of the right thigh in the area where there was a communication with large branch varicosities.  Then, a vein stripper was passed from the right calf up to the groin and the greater saphenous vein, which was divided, was stripped without any difficultly.  Several minutes of compression was used for hemostasis.  Then, the exposed branch varicosities both in the lower third of the thigh and in the calf were dissected out and then many stabs were performed to do stab phlebectomies at the level of the thigh and the level of the calf as much as the position would allow us to do.,Then in the left thigh, a groin incision was made and the greater saphenous vein was dissected out in the same way as was on the other side.  Also, an incision was made in the level of the knee and the saphenous vein was isolated there.  The saphenous vein was stripped and a several minutes of local compression was performed for hemostasis.  Then, a number of stabs to perform phlebectomy were performed at the level of the calf to excise branch varicosities to the extent that the patient's position would allow us.  Then, all incisions were closed in layers with Vicryl and staples.,Then, the patient was placed in the prone position and the stab phlebectomies of the right thigh and calf and left thigh and calf were performed using 10 to 20 stabs in each leg.  The stab phlebectomies were performed with a hook and they were very satisfactory.  Hemostasis achieved with compression and then staples were applied to the skin.,Then, the patient was rolled onto a stretcher where both legs were wrapped with the Kerlix, fluffs, and Ace bandages.,Estimated blood loss probably was about 150 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition.  The patient is to be observed, so a decision will be made whether she needs to stay overnight or be able to go home.","neurosurgery, chronic venous hypertension, varicosities, stab phlebectomies, greater saphenous vein stripping, lower extremities, vein stripping, saphenous vein, vein, incisions, hemostasis, stripping, branches, phlebectomies, thigh, calf, saphenous,"

2670, Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty., Neurosurgery, Suboccipital Craniectomy  ,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient with a large 3.5 cm acoustic neuroma.  The patient is having surgery for resection.  There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression.  The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.  The case took 12 hours.  This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room.  General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion.  After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area.  A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone.  Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.  The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum.  The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.  The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated.  Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick.  This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified.  The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.  Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly.  The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor.  There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared.  The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion.  This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  The brainstem was identified above the complex.  Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  The lateral pontine vein was maintained.  Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  There was no tumor remaining at this point.  I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  There was no bleeding.  The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.  A muscle plug was used over one area.  Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.  Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  The wound was then irrigated thoroughly.  O Vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.,The patient was extubated and taken to the ICU in stable condition.","neurosurgery, suboccipital, craniectomy, microscope, cranioplasty, acoustic neuroma, cerebellar peduncle, nerve complex, brainstem, nurolon, cavitron, kerrison, leksell, lateral pontine vein, suboccipital craniectomy, nerve, tumor"

Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3., Neurosurgery, Skull Base Reconstruction ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,PROCEDURE: , Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion.  The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen.  The neck was prepped as well.  After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl.  A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle.  After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible.  The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared.  The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out.  The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen.  The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen.  The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis.  A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use.  I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb.  It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube.  The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made.  I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion.  Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy.  For details, please see his operative note.,After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap.  A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm.  The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath.  Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle.  The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin.  The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction.  The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion.  The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel.  The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges.  The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck.  The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique.  Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes.  Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well.  There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case.  The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax.  The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl.  I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place.  The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with skin staples.  There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself.  The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.,The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples.  The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened.  The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well.","neurosurgery, rectus abdominis myocutaneous, skull base defect, squamous cell carcinoma, skull base, squamous cell, rectus sheath, abdominis, muscle, rectus, sheath"

Preoperatively patient improved with Diamox.,BRIEF NARRATIVE OF OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After satisfactory general endotracheal tube anesthesia was administered, the patient was positioned on the operating table in the supine position with the head rotated towards the left.  The right frontal area and right retroauricular area was shaved and then the head, neck, chest and abdomen were prepped and draped out in the routine manner.  The old scalp incision was opened with a Colorado needle tip and the old catheter was identified as we took the Colorado needle tip over the existing ventricular catheter, right over the sleeve on top of it and when that was entered, the CSF poured out around the ventricular catheter.  The ventricular catheter was then disconnected from the reservoir and endoscopically explored.  We saw it was blocked up proximally.  The catheter was a little adherent and required some freeing up with coagulation and on twisting of the ventricular catheter, I was able to free up the ventricular catheter, and endoscopically inserted a new Bactiseal ventricular catheter.  The catheter went down to the septum and I could see both the right and left lateral ventricles and elected to pass it into the right lateral ventricle.  It irrigated out well.  There was minimal amount of bleeding, but not significant.  The distal catheter system was tested.  There was good distal run off.  Therefore, a linear skin incision was made in the retroauricular area.  Tunneling was performed between the two incisions and a ProGAV valve set to an opening pressure of 10 with a 1-5 shunt assist was brought through the subgaleal tissue, connected to the distal catheter and a flushing reservoir was interposed between the burr hole site ventricular catheter and the ProGAV valve.  All connections were secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  Careful attention was made to make sure that the ProGAV was in the right orientation.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin, closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened, extubated and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.","neurosurgery, chloraprep, distal shunt revision, colorado needle tip, colorado needle, progav valve, shunt revision, ventricular catheter, catheter, shunt, ventricular,"

Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy.,INDICATIONS: , The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate lines were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed as well.,He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed.  The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later.,The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This was over 5 levels.  Disks and endplates were then removed.  Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well.  Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl.  This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape.,The patient was then rotated into a prone position.  The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.,Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned.  This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side.  The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This was done using pulsed lavage.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed.  The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.

She has failed conservative measures and sought operative intervention for relief of her symptoms.  For details of workup, please see the dictated operative report.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,Appropriate informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthetic.  She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected.  Second check was made prior to prepping and draping.  Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level.  We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars.  We dissected down carefully to identify the pars.  We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level.  We did this under live fluoroscopy.  We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well.  We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars.  The pars was then drilled out.  We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord.  We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty.  Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further.  Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well.  We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily.  We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material.  We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root.  The Epstein curette removed some more disc material.  Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression.  We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure.  We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure.  Hemostasis was meticulous.  The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl suture for the fascial layer, 2 Vicryl suture for the skin, and Monocryl and Steri-Strips applied.  Dressing was applied.  The patient was awoken from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  150 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION:,  To PACU in stable condition having tolerated the procedure well, to mobilize routinely when she is comfortable to go to her home.","neurosurgery, thoracic right-sided discectomy, herniated nucleus pulposus, discectomy, thoracic, herniated,"

Additional aspect of the temporalis muscle and fascia were incised with cutting Bovie current with effort made to preserve the posterior limb of the external carotid artery.  The scalp and temporalis muscle were then retracted anteroinferiorly with 0 silk sutures, attached rubber bands and Allis clamps and similar retraction of the posterior aspect of temporalis was retracted with 0 silk suture, attached with rubber bands and Allis clamps.  The bone flap, which had not been fixed in place was removed.  An additional portion of the temporofrontal bone based at the zygoma was removed with a B1 dissecting tool, B1 attached to the Midas Rex instrumentation.  Further bone removal was accomplished with Leksell rongeur, and hemostasis controlled with the use of bone wax.,At this point, a retractor was placed along the frontal lobe for visualization of the perichiasmatic cistern with visualization made of the optic nerve and carotid artery.  It should be noted that cottonoid paddies were placed over the brain to protect the cortical surface of the brain both underneath the retractor and the remainder of the exposed cortex.  The sylvian fissure was then dissected with the dissection description being dictated by Dr. X.,Following successful splitting of the sylvian fissure to its apparent midplate, attention was next turned to the temporal tip where the approximate location of the cerebral aneurysm noted on CT angio, as well as conventional arteriography was noted and a peel incision was made extending from the temporal tip approximately 3 cm posterior.  This was enlarged with bipolar coagulation and aspiration and inferior dissection accomplished under the operating microscope until the dome of, what appeared to be, an aneurysm could be visualized.,Dissection around the dome with bipolar coagulation and aspiration revealed a number of abnormal vessels, which appeared to be involved with the aneurysm at its base and these were removed with bipolar coagulation.  Until circumferential dissection revealed 1 major arterial supply to the base of the aneurysm, this was felt to be able to be handled with bipolar coagulation, which was done and the vessel then cut with microscissors and the aneurysm removed in toto.,Attention was next turned to the apparent nidus of the arteriovenous malformation, which was somewhat medial and inferior to the aneurysm and the nidus was then dissected with the use of bipolar coagulation and aspiration microscissors as further described by Dr. X. With removal of the arteriovenous malformation, attention was then turned to the previous frontal cortical incision, which was the site of partial decompression of the patient's intracerebral hematoma on the day of her admission.  Self-retaining retractors were placed within this cortical incision, and the hematoma cavity entered with additional hematoma removed with general aspiration and irrigation.  Following removal of additional hematoma, the bed of the hematoma site was lined with Surgicel.  Irrigation revealed no further active bleeding, and it was felt that at this time both the arteriovenous malformation, associated aneurysm, and intracerebral hematoma had been sequentially dealt with.,The cortical surface was then covered with Surgicel and the dura placed over the surface of the brain after coagulation of the dural edges, the freeze dried fascia, which had been used at the time of the 1st surgery was replaced over the surface of the brain with additional areas of cortical exposure covered with a DuraGuard.  The 2nd bone flap from the inferior frontotemporal region centered along the zygoma was reattached to the initial bone flap at 3 sites using a small 2-holed plate and 3-mm screws and the portable minidriver.,With this, return of the inferior plate accomplished, it was possible to reposition the bone flaps into their initial configuration, and attachments were secured anterior and posterior with somewhat longer 2-holed plates and 3-mm screws to the frontal and posterior temporal parietal region.  The wound was then closed.  It should be noted that a pledget of Gelfoam had been placed over the entire dural complex prior to returning the bone flap.  The wound was then closed by approximating the temporalis muscle with 2-0 Vicryl suture, the fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, and the galea was closed with 2-0 interrupted suture, and the skin approximated with staples.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications.","neurosurgery, hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, pterional craniotomy, bone flap, bipolar coagulation, arteriovenous, pterional, malformation, hematoma, intracerebral, "
2676, Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma.  Endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus., Neurosurgery, Pituitary Adenomectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma, endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus, harvesting of dermal fascia abdominal fat graft, placement of abdominal fat graft into sella turcica, reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm, repair of nasal septal deviation, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique, and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This man has undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resections of his tumor, which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma.  He did not return for followup or radiotherapy as instructed, and the tumor has regrown.  For this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove as much tumor as possible.  The high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory was made clear to him.  Many risks including CSF leak and blindness were discussed in detail.  After clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The back was prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.,A 14-gauge Tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space.  Clear and colorless CSF issued forth.  A catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle was removed.  The catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.,This no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas.  Via injections through the lumbar drain, one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor.  This improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.,The patient was then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest was affixed.  He was placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The fluoroscope C-arm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection.  The metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope.  The oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the abdominal region, and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was carefully closed in layers.,I then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril.  The middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.  Needle Bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium.  The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid.  I entered into the sphenoid.,There was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and I slowly and carefully worked through all this.  I identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which was very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which I exposed the very medial portion of.  The opening was wide until I had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.,The operating microscope was then utilized.  Working under magnification, I used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.,The dura was then carefully opened in the midline, and I immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma.  A frozen section was obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features.,Slowly and meticulously, I worked to remove the tumor.  I used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free.  The tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic.,Slowly and carefully, I systematically entered the sellar contents until I could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right.  There appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left.  It was consistent with what we saw on the MRI imaging.,The portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter.  A large amount of this was removed.  There was a CSF leak, as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.,Under high magnification, I actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor.  While there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus.  In fact, I reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well.,I reasoned that I had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression.  Attention was therefore turned to closure.,The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  I asked Anesthesiology to perform a Valsalva maneuver, and there was no evidence of bleeding.,Attention was turned to closure and reconstruction.  I placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air.  Using a polypropylene insert, I reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm.,DuraSeal was placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and DuraSeal.,I inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation.  The middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position.  There was no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open nasal packing was required.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct, and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of tumor.", 
2677, Ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision with replacement of ventricular catheter and flushing of the distal end., Neurosurgery, Shunt Revision - 3 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt.,PROCEDURE: , Ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision with replacement of ventricular catheter and flushing of the distal end.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY: , The patient is nonverbal.  He is almost 3 years old.  He presented with 2 months of irritability, vomiting, and increasing seizures.  CT scan was not conclusive, but shuntogram shows no flow through the shunt.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with his head turned to the left.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen with ChloraPrep.  Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000.  He received oxacillin.,He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve.  Subcutaneous sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts.  I separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium pressure small contour Medtronic valve.  There was some flow from the ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect.  I removed the right-angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and there was gushing of CSF under high pressure.  So, I do believe that the catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did not show any specific obstructions.  A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed through the same hole.  I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure it was in the cavity.  It entered easily and there was still just intermittent flow of CSF.  The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.,I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter.  So I did not think it was necessary to replace those at this time.  The new catheter was trimmed to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve.  The valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  The shunt pumped and refilled well.  The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal suture and Steri-Strips on the skin.  It was uncertain whether this will correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate.  If his abdominal pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve.  This will be determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill easily.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Blood loss was minimal.  None replaced.","neurosurgery, bactiseal, bactiseal catheter, codman bactiseal, blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt, ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision, ventricular catheter, shunt revision, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, catheter, ventriculoperitoneal, ventricular, shunt"

The old right frontal scalp incision was reopened in a curvilinear manner, and the Bactiseal ventricular catheter was identified as it went into the right frontal horn.  The distal end of the VA shunt was flushed and tested with heparinized saline, found to be patent, and it was then clamped.  Endoscopically, the proximal end was explored and we found debris within the lumen, and then we were able to freely move the catheter around.  We could see along the tract that the tip of the catheter had gone into the surrounding tissue and appeared to have prongs or extensions in the tract, which were going into the catheter consistent with partial proximal obstruction.  A Portnoy ventricular catheter was endoscopically introduced and then the endoscope was bend so that the catheter tip did not go into the same location where it was before, but would take a gentle curve going into the right lateral ventricle.  It flushed in quite well, was left at about 6.5 cm to 7 cm and connected to the existing straight connector and secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin and closed in a routine manner using two 3-0 Vicryl for the galea and a 4-0 running Monocryl for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient was awakened and extubated having tolerated the procedure well without complications.  It should be noted that the when we were irrigating through the ventricular catheter, fluid easily came out around the catheter indicating that the patient had partial proximal obstruction so that we could probably flow around the old shunt tract and perhaps this was leading to some of the symptomatology or findings of fluid along the chest.","neurosurgery, ventriculoatrial shunt, endoscopic proximal shunt revision, endoscopic proximal shunt, portnoy ventricular catheter, shunt malfunction, shunt revision, ventricular catheter, shunt, endoscopic, ventricular, proximal, catheter,"

Post-fixation neurologic examination normal.,CLINICAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 41-year-old female who presented to me with severe cervical spondylosis and myelopathy.  She was referred to me by Dr. X.  The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate.  Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days.  She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities.  No airway issues.  It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.,I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.,During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.,Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.  X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes.,The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on.,The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days.  Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery.  She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course.,The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family.","neurosurgery, cervical spondylosis, anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression, fusion, pmt, crown, vest, pmt halo, cervical,"

The occipital area was shaven bilaterally and then the areas of the prior scalp incisions were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine after routine prepping and draping.  Both U-shaped scalp incisions were opened exposing both the left and the right ventricular catheters as well as the old low pressure reservoir, which might have been leading to the coaptation of the ventricles.  The patient also had a right subtemporal depression, which was full preoperatively.  The entire old apparatus was dissected out.  We then cut both the ventricular catheters and secured them with sutures so that __________ could be inserted.  They were both inspected.  No definite debris were seen.  After removing the ventricular catheters, the old tracts were inspected and we could see where there was coaptation of the ventricles against the ventricular catheter.  On the right side, we elected to insert the Portnoy ventricular catheter and on the left a new Bactiseal catheter was inserted underneath the corpus callosum in a different location.  The old valve was dissected out and the proGAV valve with a 2-0 shunt assist was inserted and secured with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The proGAV valve was then connected to a Bactiseal distal tubing, which was looped in a cephalad way and then curved towards the left burr hole site and then the Portnoy catheter on the right was secured with a right-angled sleeve and then interposed between it and the left burr hole site with a flushing reservoir.  All connections secured with 2-0 Ethibond suture and a small piece of Bactiseal tubing between the flushing reservoir and the connector, which secured the left Bactiseal tubing to the two other Bactiseal tubings one being the distal Bactiseal tubing going towards the proGAV valve, which was set to an opening pressure of 8 and the other one being the Bactiseal tubing, which was going towards the flushing reservoir.,All the wounds were irrigated out with bacitracin and then closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.

She subsequently actually done reasonably well until about a month ago when she developed progressive severe intractable pain.  Imaging study showed that the distal hardware at the plate itself had fractured consistent with incomplete fusion across her osteomyelitis area.  There was no evidence of infection on the imaging or with her laboratory studies.  In addition, she developed a pretty profound stenosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1 that appeared to be recurrent as well.  She now presents for revision of her hardware, extension of fusion, and decompression.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  She was placed on the operative table in the prone position.  Back was prepared with Betadine, iodine, and alcohol.  We elliptically excised her old incision and extended this caudally so that we had access from the existing hardware fixation all the way down to her sacrum.  The locking nuts were removed from the screw post and both plates refractured or significantly weakened and had a crease in it.  After these were removed, it was obvious that the bottom screws were somewhat loosened in the pedicle zone so we actually tightened one up and that fit good snugly into the nail when we redirected so that it actually reamed up into the upper aspect of the vertebral body in much more secure purchase.  We then dressed the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels which were profoundly stenotic.  This was a combination of scar and overgrown bone.  She had previously undergone bilateral hemilaminectomies at L4-5 so we removed scar bone and actually cleaned and significantly decompressed the dura at both of these levels.  After completing this, we inserted the Capstone interbody spacer filled with morselized autograft bone and some BMP sponge into the disk space at both levels.  We used 10 x 32 mm spacers at both L4-L5 and L5-S1.  This corrected the deformity and helped to preserve the correction of the stenosis and then after we cannulated the pedicles of L4, L5 and S1 tightened the pedicle screws in L3.  This allowed us to actually seat a 20 cm plate contoured to the lumbar lordosis onto the pedicle screws all the way from S1 up to the T11 level.  Once we placed the plate onto the screws and locked them in position, we then packed the remaining BMP sponge and morselized autograft bone through the plate around the incomplete fracture healing at the L1 level and then dorsolaterally at L4-L5 and L5-S1 and L3-L4, again the goal being to create a dorsal fusion and enhance the interbody fusion as well.  The wound was then irrigated copiously with bacitracin solution and then we closed in layers using #1 Vicryl in muscle and fascia, 3-0 in subcutaneous tissue and approximated staples in the skin.  Prior to closing the skin, we confirmed correct sponge and needle count.  We placed a drain in the extrafascial space and then confirmed that there were no other foreign bodies.  The Cell Saver blood was recycled and she was given two units of packed red blood cells as well.  I was present for and performed the entire procedure myself or supervised.","neurosurgery, degenerative spondylolisthesis, spondylolisthesis, stenosis, lumbar re-exploration, internal fixation plate, hemilaminectomy, diskectomy, synthetic spacers, pedicle screws, fusion, lumbar, pedicle, fixation, hardware,"

All bony prominences were adequately padded.  Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The hand was inspected.  Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture.  The sutures were removed and the wound was explored.  It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected.  The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact.  We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP.  We copiously irrigated the wound.  Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture.  The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact.  Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair.  Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury.  The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve.  The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture.  The hands were well approximated.  The nerve was not under undue tension.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture.

The patient understood major risks and complications such as death and paralysis seemingly rare, main concern is a 10 to 15% of failure rate to respond to surgery for which further surgery may or may not be indicated, small risk of wound infection, spinal fluid leak.  The patient is understanding and agreed to proceed and signed the consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, peripheral venous lines were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was intubated.  Foley catheter was in place.  The patient laid prone onto the OSI table using 6-post, pressure points were carefully padded; the back was shaved, sterilely prepped and draped.  A previous incision was infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel.  The posterior spine on the right side was exposed in routine fashion along with transverse processes in L4-L5 in the sacral ala.  Laminotomies were then performed at L4-L5 and L5-S1 in a similar fashion using Midas Rex drill with AM8 bit, inferior portion of lamina below and superior portion of lamina above, and the medial facet was drilled down to the thin shelf of bone.  The thin shelf of bone along the ligamentum flavum moved in a piecemeal fashion with 2 and 3 mm Kerrison, bone was harvested throughout to be used for bone grafting.  The L5 and S1 roots were completely unroofed in the lateral recess working lateral to the markedly hypertrophied facet joints.  Transpedicular approaches were carried out for both L4 and L5 roots working lateral to medial and medial to lateral with foraminotomies, L4-L5 roots were extensively decompressed.  Pars interarticularis were maintained.  Using angled 2-mm Kerrisons hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, the superior facet of S1 and L5 was resected increasing the dimensions for the foramen passed lateral to medial and medial to lateral without further compromise.  Pedicle screws were placed L4-L5 and S1 on the right side.  Initial hole began with Midas Rex drill, deepened with a gear shift and with 4.5 mm tap, palpating with pedicle probe.  It showed no penetration outside the pedicle vertebral body.  At L4-L5 5.5 x 45 mm screws were placed and at S1 5.5 x 40 mm screw was placed.  Good bone purchase was obtained.  Gelfoam was placed over the roots laterally, corticated transverse processes lateral facet joints were prepared, small infuse sponge was placed posterolaterally on the right side, then the local bone graft from L4 to S1.  Traction was applied between the L4-L5, L5-S1 screws locking notes were tightened out, heads were rotated fractured off about 2-3 mm traction were applied at each side, further opening the foramen for the exiting roots.  Prior to placement of BMP, the wound was irrigated with antibiotic irrigation.  Medium Hemovac drain was placed in the depth of wound, brought out through a separate stab incision.  Deep fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous fascia with #1 Vicryl, and subcuticular with 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was stapled.  The drain was sutured in place with 2-0 Vicryl and connected to closed drain system.  The patient was laid supine on the bed, extubated, and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.

The symptoms were unrelieved by conservative modalities.  The symptoms were interfering with all aspects of daily living and inability to perform any significant work endeavors.  She is understanding the risks, benefits, potential complications, as well as all treatment alternatives.  She wished to proceed with the aforementioned surgery due to her persistent symptoms.  Informed consent was obtained.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR room #5 where she was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  She was subsequently placed on the Jackson spinal table with the Wilson attachment in the prone position.  Palpation did reveal the iliac crest and suspected L5-S1 interspace.  Thereafter the lumbar spine was serially prepped and draped.  A midline incision was carried over the spinal process of L5 to S1.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  Electrocautery was then utilized to dissect through the subcutaneous tissues to the lumbar fascia.  Lumbar fascia was identified and the decussation of fibers was identified at the L5-S1 interspace.  On the left side, superior aspect dissection was carried out with the Cobb elevator and electrocautery.  This revealed the interspace of suspect level of L5-S1 on the left.  A Kocher clamp was placed between the spinous processes of the suspect level of L5-S1.  X-ray did confirm the L5-S1 interval.  Angled curet was utilized to detach the ligamentum flavum from its bony attachments at the superior edge of S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina.  Meticulous dissection was undertaken and the ligamentum flavum was removed.  Laminotomy was created with Kerrison rongeur, both proximally and distally.  The microscope was positioned and the dura was inspected.  A blunt Penfield elevator was then utilized to dissect and identify the L5-S1 nerve root on the left.  It was noted to be tented over a disc extrusion.  The nerve root was protected and medialized.  It was retracted with a nerve root retractor.  This did reveal a subligamentous disc herniation at approximately the L5-S1 disc space and neuroforaminal area.  A #15 Bard-Parker blade was utilized to create an annulotomy.  Medially, disc material was extruding through this annulotomy.  Two tier rongeur was then utilized to grasp the disc material and the disc was removed from the interspace.  Additional disc material was then removed, both to the right and left of the annulotomy.  Up and downbiting pituitary rongeurs were utilized to remove any other loose disc pieces.  Once this was completed, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  The Penfield elevator was placed in the disc space of L5-S1 and a crosstable x-ray did confirm this level.  Nerve root was again expected exhibiting the foramina.  A foraminotomy was created with a Kerrison rongeur.  Once this was created, the nerve root was again inspected and deemed free of tension.  It was mobile within the neural foramina.  The wound was again copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  A free fat graft was then harvested from the subcutaneous tissues and placed over the exposed dura.  Lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl interrupted fashion, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, and #4-0 undyed Vicryl was utilized to approximate the skin.  Compression dressing was applied.  The patient was turned, awoken, and noted to be moving all four extremities without apparent deficits.  She was taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded due to her ongoing pain syndrome that has been requiring significant narcotic medications.","neurosurgery, lumbar laminotomy with discectomy, microscopic assisted, herniated nucleus pulposus, subcutaneous tissue, ligamentum flavum, kerrison rongeur, penfield elevator, lumbar laminotomy, lumbar fascia, nerve root, discectomy, lumbar, laminotomy, herniated,"

The catheter stopped draining and on pulling back the catheter, it fractured and CT scan showed that the remaining fragment is deep to the lamina.  The patient continues to have right eye blindness and headaches, presumably from the pseudotumor cerebri.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed prone on the operating room table resting on chest rolls.  Her face was resting in a pink foam headrest.  Extreme care was taken positioning her because she weighs 92 kg.  There was a lot of extra padding for her limbs and her limbs were positioned comfortably.  The arms were not hyperextended.  Great care was taken with positioning of the head and making sure there was no pressure on her eyes especially since she already has visual disturbance.  A Foley catheter was in place.  She received IV Cipro 400 mg because she is allergic to most antibiotics.,Fluoroscopy was used to locate the lower end of the fractured catheter and the skin was marked.  It was also marked where we would try to insert the new catheter at the L4 or L3 interspinous space.,The patient was then prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A 7-cm incision was made over the L1 lamina.  The incision was carried down through the fascia all the way down to the spinous processes.  A self-retaining McCullough retractor was placed.  The laminae were quite deep.  The microscope was brought in and using the Midas Rex drill with the AM-8 bit and removing some of the spinous process of L1-L2 with double-action rongeurs, the laminotomy was then done using the drill and great care was taken and using a 2-mm rongeur, the last layer of lamina was removed exposing the epidural fat and dura.  The opening in the bone was 1.5 x 1.5 cm.,Occasionally, bipolar cautery was used for bleeding of epidural veins, but this cautery was kept to a minimum.,Under high magnification, the dura was opened with an 11 blade and microscissors.  At first, there was a linear incision vertically to the left of midline, and I then needed to make a horizontal incision more towards the right.  The upper aspect of the cauda equina was visualized and perhaps the lower end of the conus.  Microdissection under high magnification did not expose the catheter.  The fluoroscope was brought in 2 more times including getting a lateral view and the fluoroscope appeared to show that the catheter should be in this location.,I persisted with intensive microdissection and finally we could see the catheter deep to the nerves and I was able to pull it out with the microforceps.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,At this point, I then attempted lumbar puncture by making a small incision with an 11 blade in the L4 interspinous space and then later in the L3 interspinous space and attempted to puncture the dural sac with the Tuohy needle.  Dr. Y also tried.  Despite using the fluoroscope and our best attempts, we were not able to convincingly puncture the lumbar subarachnoid space and so the attempted placement of the new lumbar catheter had to be abandoned.  It will be done at a later date.,I felt it was unsafe to place a new catheter at this existing laminotomy site because it was very high up near the conus.  The potential for complications involving her spinal cord was greater and we have already had a complication of the catheter now and I just did not think it was safe to put in this location.,Under high magnification, the dura was closed with #6-0 PDS interrupted sutures.,After the dura was closed, a piece of Gelfoam was placed over the dura.  The paraspinous muscles were closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  The subcutaneous fascia was also closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted suture.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and the skin with #4-0 Vicryl Rapide.  The 4-0 Vicryl Rapide sutures were also used at the lumbar puncture sites to close the skin.,The patient was then turned carefully on to her bed after sterile dressings were applied and then taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts correct.  Blood loss minimal, none replaced.  This procedure took 5 hours.  This case was also extremely difficult due to patient's size and the difficulty of locating the catheter deep to the cauda equina.","neurosurgery, laminotomy, microdissection, lumbar spinal catheter, external lumbar drain, fluoroscopy, lumbar subarachnoid, spinal catheter, intracranial hypertension, vicryl interrupted sutures, lumbar, catheter, "

After antibiotics were discontinued, she increased over the next 2 days to an elevated white count of 31,000 with significant bandemia, metamyelocytes and myelocytes present.  She also had three episodes of vomiting and thus she is being taken to the procedure room today for a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis that may being inadvertently treated in treating her UTI.,I discussed with The patient's parents prior to the procedure the lumbar puncture and moderate sedation procedures.  The risks, benefits, alternatives, complications including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, respiratory depression.  Questions were answered to their satisfaction.  They would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After ""time out"" procedure was obtained, the child was given appropriate monitoring equipment including appropriate vital signs were obtained.  She was then given Versed 1 mg intravenously by myself.  She subsequently became sleepy, the respiratory monitors, end-tidal, cardiopulmonary and pulse oximetry were applied.  She was then given 20 mcg of fentanyl intravenously by myself.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Dr. X cleansed the patient's back in a normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  She inserted a 22-gauge x 1.5-inch spinal needle in the patient's L3-L4 interspace that was carefully identified under my direct supervision.  Clear fluid was not obtained initially, needle was withdrawn intact.  The patient was slightly repositioned by the nurse and Dr. X reinserted the needle in the L3-L4 interspace position, the needle was able to obtain clear fluid, approximately 3 mL was obtained.  The stylette was replaced and the needle was withdrawn intact and bandage was applied.  Betadine solution was cleansed from the patient's back.,During the procedure, there were no untoward complications, the end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry, and other vitals remained stable.  Of note, EMLA cream had also been applied prior procedure, this was removed prior to cleansing of the back.,Fluid will be sent for a routine cell count, Gram stain culture, protein, and glucose.,DISPOSITION: , The child returned to room on the medical floor in satisfactory condition.","neurosurgery, moderate sedation, lumbar puncture, needle, lumbar, "

Lumbar laminectomy for decompression with foraminotomies L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 microtechniques.,2.  Repair of CSF fistula, microtechniques L5-S1, application of DuraSeal.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is an 82-year-old woman who has about a four-month history now of urinary incontinence and numbness in her legs and hands, and difficulty ambulating.  She was evaluated with an MRI scan, which showed a very high-grade stenosis in her lumbar spine, and subsequent evaluation included a myelogram, which demonstrated cervical stenosis at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 as well as a complete block of the contrast at L4-L5 and no contrast at L5-S1 either and stenosis at L3-L4 and all the way up, but worse at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.  Yesterday, she underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7 and had some improvement of her symptoms and increased strength, even in the recovery room.  She was kept in the ICU because of her age and the need to bring her back to the operating room today for decompressive lumbar laminectomy.  The rationale for putting the surgery is close together that she is normally on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, though she has been cardioverted.  She and her son understand the nature, indications, and risks of the surgery, and agreed to go ahead.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought from the Neuro ICU to the operating room, where general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was rolled in a prone position on the Wilson frame.  The back was prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak, followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  Using the usual anatomical landmarks, linear midline incision was made presumed over L4-L5 and L5-S1.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue, then Bovie electrocautery was used to isolate the spinous processes.  A Kocher clamp was placed in the anterior spinous ligament and this turned out to be L5-S1.  The incision was extended rostrally and deep Gelpi's were inserted to expose the spinous processes and lamina of L3, L4, L5, and S1.  Using the Leksell rongeur, the spinous processes of L4 and L5 were removed completely, and the caudal part of L3.  A high-speed drill was then used to thin the caudal lamina of L3, all of the lamina of L4 and of L5.  Then using various Kerrison punches, I proceeded to perform a laminectomy.  Removing the L5 lamina, there was a dural band attached to the ligamentum flavum and this caused about a 3-mm tear in the dura.  There was CSF leak.  The lamina removal was continued, ligamentum flavum was removed to expose all the dura.  Then using 4-0 Nurolon suture, a running-locking suture was used to close the approximate 3-mm long dural fistula.  There was no CSF leak with Valsalva.,I then continued the laminectomy removing all of the lamina of L5 and of L4, removing the ligamentum flavum between L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1.  Foraminotomies were accomplished bilaterally.  The caudal aspect of the lamina of L3 also was removed.  The dura came up quite nicely.  I explored out along the L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots after completing the foraminotomies, the roots were quite free.  Further more, the thecal sac came up quite nicely.  In order to ensure no CSF leak, we would follow the patient out of the operating room.  The dural closure was covered with a small piece of fat.  This was all then covered with DuraSeal glue.  Gelfoam was placed on top of this, then the muscle was closed with interrupted 0 Ethibond.  The lumbodorsal fascia was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 0 Ethibond in a watertight fashion.  Scarpa's fascia was closed with a running 0 Vicryl, and finally the skin was closed with a running-locking 3-0 nylon.  The wound was blocked with 0.5% plain Marcaine.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Estimated blood loss for the case was about 100 mL.,SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNTS:  Correct.,FINDINGS:  A very tight high-grade stenosis at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.  There were adhesions between the dura and the ligamentum flavum owing to the severity and length of the stenosis.,The patient tolerated the procedure well with stable vitals throughout.","neurosurgery, microtechniques, fistula, duraseal, foraminotomies, lumbar, stenosis, cerebrospinal, lumbar laminectomy, ligamentum flavum, csf, laminectomy, lamina,"

The patient was lifting at work on 08/27/03 and felt immediate sharp pain from his back down to the left lower extremity.  He denied any previous history of back pain or back surgeries.  Because of his intractable pain as well as severe weakness in the S1 nerve root distribution, the patient was aware of all risks as well as possible complications of this type of surgery and he has agreed to pursue on.  After an informed consent was obtained, all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient.  ,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,He was wheeled back to Operating Room #5 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/28/03.  After a general anesthetic was administered, a Foley catheter was inserted.,The patient was then turned prone on the Jackson table.  All of his bony prominences were well-padded.  At this time, a myelogram was then performed.  After the lumbar spine was prepped, a #20 gauge needle was then used to perform a myelogram.  The needle was localized to the level of L3-L4 region.  Once inserted into the thecal sac, we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle.  At this time, approximately 10 cc of Conray injected into the thecal sac.  The patient was then placed in the reversed Trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast.  The myelogram did reveal that there was some space occupying lesion, most likely disc at the level of L5-S1 on the left.  There was a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the AP and the lateral projections using C-arm fluoroscopy.  At this point, the patient was then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy.  A long spinal needle was then inserted into region of surgery on the right.  The surgery was going to be on the left.  Once the spinal needle was inserted, a localizing fluoroscopy was then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the L5-S1 nerve root region.  At this time, an approximately 2 cm skin incision was made over the lumbar region, dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia.  At this time, a Weitlaner was inserted.  Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  We further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process and the lamina.  A Cobb elevator was then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process as well as the lamina on the left-hand side.  At this time, a Taylor retractor was then inserted and held there for retraction.  Suction as well as Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, a small Kerrison Rongeur was used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression.  Once the laminotomy was performed, a small _______ curette was used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac as well as the adjoining nerve roots.  Once the ligamentum flavum was removed, we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the S1 nerve root, which was compressive.  We removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the S1 nerve root.  A nerve root retractor was then placed.  Identification of disc space was then performed.  A #15 blade was then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space was then performed with a #15 blade.  A small pituitary was then inserted within the disc space and more disc material was freed and removed.  The part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear pieces of disc.  Once this was performed, we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root was essentially free.,At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  We then performed another look to see if any loose pieces of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small pieces were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur.  At this time, a small piece of Gelfoam was then used to cover the exposed nerve root.  We did not have any dural leaks during this case.  #1-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia, #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia, and #4-0 running Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Sterile dressings were then applied.  The patient was then carefully slipped over into the supine position, extubated and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.  At this time, we are still waiting to assess the patient postoperatively to assure no neurological sequela postsurgically are found and also to assess his pain level.","neurosurgery, microscopic-assisted lumbar laminectomy, discectomy, nerve root, lumbar laminectomy, herniated nucleus, thecal sac, spinal needle, nucleus pulposus, disc space, root, nerve, weakness, lumbar, laminectomy, nucleus, pulposus, myelogram"

He had previous lumbar laminectomy at L4-L5.  He was noted to have an isthmic spondylolisthesis.,Previous lumbar laminectomy exacerbated this condition and made it further unstable.  He is suffering from neurogenic claudication.  He was unresponsive to extensive conservative treatment.  He has understanding of the risks, benefits, potential complications, treatment alternatives and provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 where he was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  He was subsequently placed prone on the Jackson's spinal table with all bony prominences well padded.  His lumbar spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A previous midline incision was extended from approximate level of L3 to S1.  This was in the midline.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  ,Electrocautery was utilized to dissect through subcutaneous tissue of lumbar fascia.  The lumbar fascia was identified and split in the midline.  Subperiosteal dissection was then carried out with electrocautery and ______ elevated from the suspected levels of L3-S1.  Once this was exposed, the transverse processes, a Kocher clamp was placed and a localizing cross-table x-ray confirmed the interspace between the spinous processes of L3-L4.  Once this was completed, a self-retaining retractor was then placed.  With palpation of the spinous processes, the L4 posterior elements were noted to be significantly loosened and unstable.  These were readily mobile with digital palpation.  A rongeur was then utilized to resect the spinous processes from the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  This bone was morcellized and placed on the back table for utilization for bone grafting.  The rongeur was also utilized to thin the laminas from the inferior half of L3 to superior half of S1.  Once this was undertaken, the unstable posterior elements of L4 were meticulously dissected free until wide decompression was obtained.  Additional decompression was extended from the level of the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  The microscope was utilized during this portion of procedure for visualization.  There was noted to be no changes during the decompression portion or throughout the remainder of the surgical procedure.  Once decompression was deemed satisfactory, the nerve roots were individually inspected and due to the unstable spondylolisthesis, there was noted to be tension on the L4 and L5 nerve roots crossing the disc space at L4-L5.  Once this was identified, foraminotomies were created to allow additional mobility.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  Working type screws, provisional titanium screws were then placed at L4-l5.  This was to allow distraction and reduction of the spondylolisthesis.  These were placed in the pedicles of L4 and L5 under direct intensification.  The position of the screws were visualized, both AP and lateral images.  They were deemed satisfactory.,Once this was completed, a provisional plate was applied to the screws and distraction applied across L4-L5.  This allowed for additional decompression of the L5 and L4 nerve roots.  Once this was completed, the L5 nerve root was traced and deemed satisfactory exiting neural foramen after additional dissection and discectomy were performed.  Utilizing a series of interbody spacers, a size 8 mm spacer was placed within the L4-L5 interval.  This was taken in sequence up to a 13 mm space.  This was then reduced to a 11 mm as it was much more anatomic in nature.  Once this was completed, the spacers were then placed on the left side and distraction obtained.  Once the distraction was obtained to 11 mm, the interbody shavers were utilized to decorticate the interbody portion of L4 and L5 bilaterally.  Once this was taken to 11 mm bilaterally, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  A 11 mm height x 9 mm width x 25 mm length carbon fiber cages were packed with local bone graft and Allograft.  There were impacted at the interspace of L4-L5 under direct image intensification.  Once these were deemed satisfactory, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The provisional screws and plates were removed.  This allowed for additional compression along L4-L5 with the cage instrumentation.  Permanent screws were then placed at L4, L5, and S1 bilaterally.  This was performed under direct image intensification.  The position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, the posterolateral gutters were decorticated with an AM2 Midas Rex burr down to bleeding subchondral bone.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The morcellized Allograft and local bone graft were mixed and packed copiously from the transverse processes of L4-S1 bilaterally.  A 0.25 inch titanium rod was contoured of appropriate length to span from L4-S1.  Appropriate cross connecters were applied and the construct was placed over the pedicle screws.  They were tightened and sequenced to allow additional posterior reduction of the L4 vertebra.  Once this was completed, final images in the image intensification unit were reviewed and were deemed satisfactory.  All connections were tightened and retightened in Torque 2 specifications.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The dura was inspected and noted to be free of tension.  At the conclusion of the procedure, there was noted to be no changes on the SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitors.  An 8-inch Hemovac drain was placed exiting the wound.  The lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl in interrupted fashion, the subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, surgical stainless steel clips were used to approximate the skin.  The remainder of the Hemovac was assembled.  Bulky compression dressing utilizing Adaptic, 4x4, and ABDs was then affixed to the lumbar spine with Microfoam tape.  He was turned and taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded.",
2699, Left-sided large hemicraniectomy for traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure.  She came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull. , Neurosurgery, Hemicraniectomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Left-sided large hemicraniectomy for traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: ,  The patient is a patient well known to my service.  She came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull.  I took her to the operating a few days ago for a large right-sided hemicraniectomy to save her life.  I spoke with the family, the mom, especially about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure, most especially given the fact that she had undergone a very severe traumatic brain injury with a very poor GCS of 3 in some brainstem reflexes.  I discussed with them that this was a life-saving procedure and the family agreed to proceed with surgery as a level 1.  We went to the operating room at that time and we did a very large right-sided hemicraniectomy.  The patient was put in the intensive care unit.  We had placed also at that time a left-sided intracranial pressure monitor both which we took out a few days ago.  Over the last few days, the patient began to slowly deteriorate little bit on her clinical examination, that is, she was at first localizing briskly with the right side and that began to be less brisk.  We obtained a CT scan at this point, and we noted that she had a fair amount of swelling in the left hemisphere with about 1.5 cm of midline shift.  At this point, once again I discussed with the family the possibility of trying to save her life and go ahead and doing a left-sided very large hemicraniectomy with this __________  this was once again a life-saving procedure and we proceeded with the consent of mom to go ahead and do a level 1 hemicraniectomy of the left side.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  She was already intubated and under general anesthesia.  The head was put in a 3-pin Mayfield headholder with one pin in the forehead and two pins in the back to be able to put the patient with the right-hand side down and the left-hand side up since on the right-hand side, she did not have a bone flap which complicated matters a little bit, so we had to use a 3-pin Mayfield headholder.  The patient tolerated this well.  We sterilely prepped everything and we actually had already done a midline incision prior to this for the prior surgery, so we incorporated this incision into the new incision, and to be able to open the skin on the left side, we did a T-shaped incision with T vertical portion coming from anterior to the ear from the zygoma up towards the vertex of the skull towards the midline of the skin.  We connected this.  Prior to this, we brought in all surgical instrumentation under sterile and standard conditions.  We opened the skin as in opening a book and then we also did a myocutaneous flap.  We brought in the muscle with it.  We had a very good exposure of the skull.  We identified all the important landmarks including the zygoma inferiorly, the superior sagittal suture as well as posteriorly and anteriorly.  We had very good landmarks, so we went ahead and did one bur hole and the middle puncta right above the zygoma and then brought in the craniotome and did a very large bone flap that measured about 7 x 9 cm roughly, a very large decompression of the left side.  At this point, we opened the dura and the dura as soon as it was opened, there was a small subdural hematoma under a fair amount of pressure and cleaned this very nicely irrigated completely the brain and had a few contusions over the operculum as well as posteriorly.  All this was irrigated thoroughly.  Once we made sure we had absolutely great hemostasis without any complications, we went ahead and irrigated once again and we had controlled the meddle meningeal as well as the superior temporal artery very nicely.  We had absolutely good hemostasis.  We put a piece of Gelfoam over the brain.  We had opened the dura in a cruciate fashion, and the brain clearly bulging out despite of the fact that it was in the dependent position.  I went ahead and  irrigated everything thoroughly putting a piece of DuraGen as well as a piece of Gelfoam with very good hemostasis and proceeded to close the skin with running nylon in place.  This running nylon we put in place in order not to put any absorbables, although I put a few 0 popoffs just to approximate the skin nicely.  Once we had done this, irrigated thoroughly once again the skin.  We cleaned up everything and then we took the patient off __________ anesthesia and took the patient back to the intensive care unit.  The EBL was about 200 cubic centimeters.  Her hematocrit went down to about 21 and I ordered the patient to receive one unit of blood intraoperatively which they began to work on as we began to continue to do the work and the sponges and the needle counts were correct.  No complications.  The patient went back to the intensive care unit.","neurosurgery, large hemicraniectomy, intracranial pressure, multiple fractures, skull, traumatic brain injury, mayfield headholder, injury, hemicraniectomyNOTE"

Posterior cervical fusion C4-C5.,3.  Songer wire.,4.  Right iliac bone graft.,TECHNIQUE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room.  Preoperative evaluations included previous cervical spine surgery.  The patient initially had some relief; however, his left arm pain did recur and gradually got worse.  Repeat studies including myelogram and postspinal CTs revealed some blunting of the nerve root at C4-C5 and C5-C6.  There was also noted to be some annular bulges at C3-C4, and C6-C7.  The CT scan in March revealed that the fusion was not fully solid.  X-rays were done in November including flexion and extension views, it appeared that the fusion was solid.,The patient had been on pain medication.  The patient had undergone several nonoperative treatments.  He was given the option of surgical intervention.  We discussed Botox, I discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression.  I explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck, and that no guarantee would help, there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it was from the anterior surgery.  If at the time of surgery there was some motion of the C4-C5 level, I would recommend a fusion.  The patient was a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but has not quit smoking.  I have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft.  I explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life.  Even if this type of bone graft was used, there was no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completely.,The patient also was advised that if I did a fusion, I would also use post instrumentation, which was a wire.  The wire would be left permanently.,Even with all these procedures, there was no guarantee that his symptoms would improve.  His numbness, tingling, and weakness could get worse rather than better, his neck pain and arm pain could persist.  He still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure.  Other procedures may be necessary later.  There is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function.  He could lose total control of his arms or legs and end up in the bed for the rest of his life.  He could develop chronic regional pain syndromes.  He could get difficulty swallowing or eating.  He could have substantial weakness in the arm.  He was advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent, severe, and unremitting.,He was also offered his records if he would like any other pain medications or seek other treatments, he was advised that Dr. X would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgery.,He stated he understood all the risks.  He did not wish to get any other treatments.  He said the pain has reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , In the operating room, he was given general endotracheal anesthesia.,I then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic rolls.  His head was controlled by a horseshoe holder.  The anesthesiologist checked the eye positions to make sure there was no pressure on the orbits and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minutes.  The arms, the right hip, and the neck was then prepped and draped.  Care was taken to position both arms and both legs.  Pulses were checked.,A midline incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine.  A loupe magnification and headlamp illumination was used.  Bleeding vessels were cauterized.  Meticulous hemostasis was carried out throughout the procedure.  Gradually and carefully I exposed the spinous process of the C6, C5, and C4.  A lateral view was done after an instrument in place.  This revealed the C6-C7 level.  I therefore did a small laminotomy opening at C4-C5.  I placed an instrument and x-rays confirmed C4-C5 level.,I stripped the muscles from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a self-retaining retractor.,Once I identified the level, I then used a bur to thin the lamina of C5.  I used a 1-mm, followed by a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off C5 on the left.  I removed some of the superior lamina of C6 and some of the inferior lamina of C4.  This allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve roots and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the C5 and C6 nerve roots.  There was some bleeding from the epidural veins and a bipolar cautery was used.  Absolutely no retractors were ever placed in the canal.  There was no retraction.  I was able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc spaces to make sure there was no fragments of disc or herniation disc and none were found.,At the end of the procedure, the neuroforamen were widely patent.  The nerve roots had been fully decompressed.,I then checked stability.  There was micromotion at the C4-C5 level.  I therefore elected to proceed with a fusion.,I debrided the interspinous ligament between C4 and C5.  I used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of C5 and the inferior portion of C4.  Using a small drill, I opened the facet at C4-C5.  I then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage.  I used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at C4-C5.,Attention was turned to the right and left hip, which was also prepped.  An incision made over the iliac crest.  Bleeding vessels were cauterized.  I exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest.

After adequate general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation was obtained, the patient was placed prone on the Jackson table.  Lumbar spine was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision was carried out from L4 to S1.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar and Bovie cauterization.  A Weitlaner was placed in the wound and a subperiosteal dissection was carried out identifying the lamina of L4, L5, and sacrum.  At this time, laminectomy was carried out of L5-S1.  Thecal sac was retracted rightward and the foramen was opened and unilateral medial facetectomy was carried out in the disk space.  At this time, the disk was entered with a #15 blade and bipolar.  The disk was entered with straight up and down-biting pituitaries, curettes, and the high speed drill and we were able to takedown calcified herniated disk.  We were able to reestablish the disk space, it was very difficult, required meticulous dissection and then drilling with a diamond bur in the disk space underneath the spinal canal, very carefully holding the spinal canal out of harm's way as well as the exiting nerve root.  Once this was done, we used rasps to remove more disk material anteriorly and under the midline to the left side and then we put in interbody graft of BMP 8 mm graft from Medtronic.  At this time, Dr. X will dictate the posterolateral fusion, pedicle screw fixation to L4 to S1 with compression and will dictate the closure of the wound.  There were no complications.","neurosurgery, revision laminectomy, discectomy, facetectomy, arthrodesis, lumbar spondylosis, hypermobility, collapsed disk space, medial facetectomy, interbody graft, herniated disk, interbody, laminectomy, disk, therapy, lumbar, herniated, space,"

Last surgery consisted of four-level decompression on 08/28/06.  The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius.  Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis.  It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention; however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial.  Based on this, I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with no spinal instrumentation.  Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection.  There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord.  This may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma.  There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis.  This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair.  The patient understood the risk of the surgery.  I told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring.  The SSEPs were normal, and the EMGs were silent during the entire case.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support.  Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region.  All pressure points were padded.  I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision.  This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar.  Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of C2 was then identified.  There was absence of the spinous process of C3, C4, C5, and C6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina.  With this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3, C4, C5, and C6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery.  There was also a dural tear on the right C3-C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6-0 and later with Tisseel.  By careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7.  There was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated.  At two points, I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam.  After repair of the dural tear, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia; Vicryl 2-0 inverted interrupted sutures to the dermis and a running nylon 2-0 continuous vertical mattress stitch.  The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.",

This procedure is being done as an emergency procedure in an attempt to save his life and maximize the potential for recovery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room intubated.  The patient previously was given fresh frozen plasma plus recombinant activated factor VII.  The patient had a roll placed on his right shoulder, head was maintained three point fixation with a Mayfield headholder.  The right side of the head was shaved, thoroughly prepped and draped, a large ? scalp incision was marked, infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel, Raney clips were applied to the scalp margins, hemostasis, temporalis muscle and fascia, pericranium opened and aligned with incision, flap was reflected anteriorly.  Burr holes are placed low in the temporal bone at the keyhole posteriorly and then superiorly with a perforator, then using Midas Rex drill with a B1 foot plate a free flap was turned.  The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion, acute subdural hematoma was evacuated.  There was a small arterial bleeder in the anterior parietal region, which was controlled with bipolar electrocautery.  Using suction and biopsy forceps, acute clot was resected from the frontotemporoparietal and occipital poles, subdural space was irrigated, no further bleeders were encountered.  Dura was closed with 4-0 Nurolon.  A subdural Camino ICP catheter was placed in the subdural space.  Bone flaps secured in place with neuro clips with 5 mm screws, central pack up suture was placed, dural tack up sutures were placed using 4-0 Nurolon prior to placement of the bone flap.  The wound was irrigated with saline, temporalis muscle and fascia closed with 2-0 Vicryl, subgaleal Hemovac was placed, galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, and scalp with staples.  ICP monitor and the Hemovac were sutured in place with 2-0 Vicryl.  The patient was taken out of the head holder, a sterile dressing placed.  The head was wrapped.  The patient was taken directly to ICU, still intubated in guarded condition.  Brain was nicely soft and pulsatile.  At the termination of the procedure, no significant contusion of the brain was identified.  Final sponge and needle counts are correct.

He presented several days later with headaches as well as a draining wound.  He was subsequently taken back for a dural repair.  For the last 10 to 11 days, he has been okay except for the last two days he has had increasing headaches, has nausea, vomiting, as well as positional migraines.  He has fullness in the back of his wound.  The patient's risks and benefits have been conferred him due to the fact that he does have persistent spinal leak.  The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration of his wound with dural repair with possible stabilization pending what we find intraoperatively.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #7.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  The patient was given intraoperative antibiotics.  The patient was rolled onto the OSI table in usual prone position and prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,Initially, a midline incision was made from the cephalad to caudad level.  Full-thickness skin flaps were developed.  It was seen immediately that there was large amount of copious fluid emanating from the wound, clear-like fluid, which was the cerebrospinal fluid.  Cultures were taken, aerobic, anaerobic, AFB, fungal.  Once this was done, the paraspinal muscles were affected from the posterior elements.  It was seen that there were no facet complexes on the right side at L4-L5 and L5-S1.  It was seen that the spine was listhesed at L5 and that the dural sac was pinched at the L4-5 level from the listhesis.  Once this was done; however, the fluid emanating from the dura could not be seen appropriately.  Complete laminectomy at L4 was performed as well extending the L5 laminectomy more to the left.  Complete laminectomy at L3 was done.  Once this was done within the subarticular recess on the right side at the L4 pedicle level, a rent in the dura was seen.  Once this was appropriately cleaned, the dural edges were approximated using a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  A Valsalva confirmed no significant lead after the repair was made.  There was a significant laterolisthesis at L4-L5 and due to the fact that there were no facet complexes at L5-S1 and L4-L5 on the right side as well as there was a significant concavity on the right L4-L5 disk space which was demonstrated from intraoperative x-rays and compared to preoperative x-rays, it was decided from an instrumentation.  The lateral pedicle screws were placed at L4, L5, and S1 using the standard technique of Magerl.  After this the standard starting point was made.  Trajectory was completed with gearshift and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  Once this was done, this was undertapped at 1 mm and resounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  The screws were subsequently placed.  Tricortical purchase was obtained at S1 ________ appropriate size screws.  Precontoured titanium rod was then appropriately planned and placed between the screws at L4, L5, and S1.  This was done on the right side first.  The screw was torqued at S1 appropriately and subsequently at L5.  Minimal compression was then placed between L5 and L4 to correct the concavity as well as laterolisthesis and the screw appropriately torqued at L4.  Neutral compression distraction was obtained on the left side.  Screws were torqued at L4, L5, and S1 appropriately.  Good placement was seen both in AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Laterolisthesis corrected appropriately at L4 and L5.,Posterior spinal fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements at L4-L5 and the sacral ala with a curette.  Once good bleeding subchondral bone was appreciated, the morselized bone from the laminectomy was morselized with corticocancellous bone chips together with demineralized bone matrix.  This was placed in the posterior lateral gutters.  DuraGen was then placed over the dural repair, and after this, fibrin glue was placed appropriately.  Deep retractors then removed from the confines of the wound.  Fascia was closed using interrupted Prolene running suture #1.  Once this was done, suprafascial drain was placed appropriately.  Subcutaneous tissues were opposed using a 2-0 Prolene suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  Wound was dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4 x 4's, and tape.  The drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was rolled on stretcher in usual supine position, extubated uneventfully, and taken back to the recovery room in a satisfactory stable condition.  No complications arose.",

This is considered as a life threatening admission with a hemorrhage in the temporal lobe extending into the frontal lobe and with significant mass effect.,The patient apparently became hemiplegic suddenly today.  She also had an episode of incoherence and loss of consciousness as well as loss of bowel/urine.,She was brought to Emergency Room where a CT of the brain showed that she had significant hemorrhage of the right temporal lobe extending into the external capsule and across into the frontal lobe.  There is significant mass effect.  There is mixed density in the parenchyma of the temporal lobe.,She was originally scheduled for elective craniotomy for biopsy of the temporal lobe to find out why she was having spontaneous hemorrhages.  However, this event triggered her family to bring her to the emergency room, and this is considered a life threatening admission now with a significant mass effect, and thus we will proceed directly today for evacuation of ICH as well as biopsy of the temporal lobe as well as the dura.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was anesthetized by the anesthesiology team.  Appropriate central line as well as arterial line, Foley catheter, TED, and SCDs were placed.  The patient was positioned supine with a three-point Mayfield head pin holder.  Her scalp was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  Her former incisional scar was barely and faintly noticed; however, through the same scalp scar, the same incision was made and extended slightly inferiorly.  The scalp was resected anteriorly.  The subdural scar was noted, and hemostasis was achieved using Bovie cautery.  The temporalis muscle was reflected along with the scalp in a subperiosteal manner, and the titanium plating system was then exposed.,The titanium plating system was then removed in its entirety.  The bone appeared to be quite fused in multiple points, and there were significant granulation tissue through the burr hole covers.,The granulation tissue was quite hemorrhagic, and hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery as well as Bovie cautery.,The bone flap was then removed using Leksell rongeur, and the underlying dura was inspected.  It was quite full.  The 4-0 sutures from the previous durotomy closure was inspected, and more of the inferior temporal bone was resected using high-speed drill in combination with Leksell rongeur.  The sphenoid wing was also resected using a high-speed drill as well as angled rongeur.,Hemostasis was achieved on the fresh bony edges using bone wax.  The dura pack-up stitches were noted around the periphery from the previous craniotomy.  This was left in place.,The microscope was then brought in to use for the remainder of the procedure until closure.  Using a #15 blade, a new durotomy was then made.  Then, the durotomy was carried out using Metzenbaum scissors, then reflected the dura anteriorly in a horseshoe manner, placed anteriorly, and this was done under the operating microscope.  The underlying brain was quite edematous.,Along the temporal lobe there was a stain of xanthochromia along the surface.  Thus a corticectomy was then accomplished using bipolar cautery, and the temporal lobe at this level and the middle temporal gyrus was entered.  The parenchyma of the brain did not appear normal.  It was quite vascular.  Furthermore, there was a hematoma mixed in with the brain itself.  Thus a core biopsy was then performed in the temporal tip.  The overlying dura was inspected and it was quite thickened, approximately 0.25 cm thick, and it was also highly vascular, and thus a big section of the dura was also trimmed using bipolar cautery followed by scissors, and several pieces of this vascularized dura was resected for pathology.  Furthermore, sample of the temporal lobe was cultured.,Hemostasis after evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma using controlled suction as well as significant biopsy of the overlying dura as well as intraparenchymal lesion was accomplished.  No attempt was made to enter into the sylvian fissure.  Once hemostasis was meticulously achieved, the brain was inspected.  It still was quite swollen, known that there was still hematoma in the parenchyma of the brain.  However, at this time it was felt that since there is no diagnosis made intraoperatively, we would need to stage this surgery further should it be needed once the diagnosis is confirmed.  DuraGen was then used for duraplasty because of the resected dura.  The bone flap was then repositioned using Lorenz plating system.  Then a medium Hemovac drain was placed in subdural space.  Temporalis muscle was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl.  The galea was then reapproximated using inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  The scalp was then reapproximated using staples.  The head was then dressed and wrapped in a sterile fashion.,She was witnessed to be extubated in the operating room postoperatively, and she followed commands briskly.  The pupils are 3 mm bilaterally reactive to light.  I accompanied her and transported her to the ICU where I signed out to the ICU attending.",
2706, Left C5-6 hemilaminotomy and foraminotomy with medial facetectomy for microscopic decompression of nerve root., Neurosurgery, Hemilaminotomy & Foraminotomy ,"PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left cervical radiculopathy at C5, C6,OPERATION: , Left C5-6 hemilaminotomy and foraminotomy with medial facetectomy for microscopic decompression of nerve root.,After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was taken to the OR.  After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted.  At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine.  A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated.  After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken.  This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level.  Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified.  After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken.  This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time.  At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina.  The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe.  This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur.  However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone.  Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area.  After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur.  At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed.  However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade.  Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery.  After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin.  Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches.  The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon.  The skin was reapproximated using a running 000 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient was then extubated in the OR and transferred to the Recovery room in stable condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  minimal.","neurosurgery, foraminotomy with medial facetectomy, facetectomy for microscopic decompression, decompression of nerve root, hemilaminotomy and foraminotomy, decompression of nerve, microscopic decompression, medial facetectomy, kerrison rongeur, nerve root, spinous processes, facetectomy, kerrison, hemilaminotomy, foraminotomy,"
2707, Patient returns for his first followup after shunt surgery., Neurosurgery, First Followup - Shunt Surgery ,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  Mr. A is an 86-year-old man who returns for his first followup after shunt surgery.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,I have followed Mr. A since May 2008.  He presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control.  We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June of 2008 and ,Mr. A underwent shunt surgery performed by Dr. X on August 1st.  A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.,Mr. A comes today with his daughter, Pam and together they give his history.,Mr. A has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him.  With respect to his walking, his daughter tells me that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine, but could not before his surgery.  His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment.  With respect to his bladder, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper.,With respect to his cognition, both Pam and the patient say that his thinking has improved.  The other daughter, Patty summarized it best according to two of them.  She said, ""I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.""  Mr. A has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or at the abdomen.,MEDICATIONS: , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Detrol LA 4 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Imodium daily, Omega-3, fish oil, and Lasix.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  Mr. A is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.,The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.,Mental Status:  Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge.  He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations.  Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice.  This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.,Gait:  Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool.  He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28.  This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.,Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Face symmetric.  No dysarthria.,Motor:  Normal for bulk and strength.,Coordination:  Slow for finger-to-nose.,IMAGING: , CT scan was reviewed from 10/15/2008.  It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm.  By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection.  This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extraaxial fluid collections.  There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.,ASSESSMENT: , Mr. A has made some improvement since shunt surgery.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Adult hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Gait impairment (781.2).,3.  Urinary incontinence and urgency (788.33).,4.  Cognitive impairment (290.0).,PLAN:,  I had a long discussion with Mr. A and his daughter.  We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because I believe I see a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.  I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptotic and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.,Mr. A asked me about whether he will be able to drive again.  Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test.  I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe ,Mr. A is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time.  I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.",

He was referred for stereotactic radiosurgery.  The risks of the radiosurgical treatment were discussed with the patient including, but not limited to, failure to completely obliterate the AVM, need for additional therapy, radiation injury, radiation necrosis, headaches, seizures, visual loss, or other neurologic deficits.  The patient understands these risks and would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient arrived to Outpatient CyberKnife Suite one day prior to the treatment.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was constructed.  Initial imaging was obtained by the CyberKnife system.  The patient was then transported over to the CT scanner at Stanford.  Under the supervision of Dr. X, 125 mL of Omnipaque 250 contrast was administered.  Dr. X then supervised the acquisition of 1.2-mm contiguous axial CT slices.  These images were uploaded over the hospital network to the treatment planning computer, and the patient was discharged home.,Treatment plan was then performed by me.  I outlined the tumor volume.  Inverse treatment planning was used to generate the treatment plan for this patient.  This resulted in a total dose of 20 Gy delivered to 84% isodose line using a 12.5 mm collimator.  The maximum dose within this center of treatment volume was 23.81 Gy.  The volume treated was 2.972 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 1.9 x 2.7 x 1.6 cm.  The volume treated at the reference dose was 98%.  The coverage isodose line was 79%.  The conformality index was 1.74 and modified conformality index was 1.55.  The treatment plan was reviewed by me and Dr. Y of Radiation Oncology, and the treatment plan was approved.,On the morning of May 14, 2004, the patient arrived at the Outpatient CyberKnife Suite.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was applied.  Initial imaging was used to bring the patient into optimal position.  The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to deliver the 20 Gy to the AVM margin.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was given 8 mg of Decadron for prophylaxis and discharged home.,Followup will consist of an MRI scan in 6 months.  The patient will return to our clinic once that study is completed.,I was present and participated in the entire procedure on this patient consisting of CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital AVM.,Dr. X was present during the entire procedure and will be dictating his own operative note.","neurosurgery, ct-guided, occipital, cyberknife, frameless stereotactic radiosurgery, occipital arteriovenous malformation, conformality index, arteriovenous malformation, malformation, avm, arteriovenous,"

An incision was made over the posterior spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2.  A Weitlaner retractor was placed and cutting Bovie current was used to incise the fascia overlying the dorsal spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2.  An additional muscular ligamentous attachment was dissected free bilaterally with cutting Bovie current osteotome and Cobb elevator.  The cerebellar retractors were placed in the wound and obvious deformation of the lamina particularly on the left side at T12 was apparent.  Initially, on the patient's left side, pedicle screws were placed in T11 and L1.  The inferior articular facet was removed at T11 and an awl placed at the proximal location of the pedicle.  Placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy.  The awl was in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control, the pedicle was probed to the mid portion of the body of T11.  A 40-mm Click'X screw, 6.5 mm diameter with rod holder was then threaded into the T11 vertebral body.,Attention was next turned to the L1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse processes with the superior articular facet and intra-articular process was located using an AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment to the Midas Rex instrumentation.  The area was decorticated, an awl was placed, and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in L1.  Using a pedicle probe, the pedicle was then probed to the mid body of L1 and a 7-mm diameter 45-mm in length Click'X Synthes screw with rod holder was placed in the L1 vertebral body.,At this point, an elongated rod was placed on the left side for purposes of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the MRI findings of significant compression on the patient's ventral canal on the right side.  Attention was next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above was carried out with operating room microscope and at this point, the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at T12 was noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis.  The anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the T12 was incised with cutting Bovie current and the posterior spinous process at T12 removed with a Leksell rongeur.  It was necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at T11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fractures at T12.,At this point, a laminectomy was performed using 45-degree Kerrison rongeur, both 2 mm and 4 mm, and Leksell rongeur.  There was an epidural hematoma encountered to the midline and left side at the mid portion of the T12 laminectomy and this was extending superiorly to the T11-T12 interlaminar space.  Additionally, there was marked instability of the facets bilaterally at T12 and L1.  These facets were removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur and Leksell rongeur.  Bony compression both superiorly and laterally from fractured bony elements was removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur until the thecal sac was completely decompressed.  The exiting nerve roots at T11 and T12 were visualized and followed with Frazier dissectors, and these nerve roots were noted to be completely free.  Hemostasis was controlled with bipolar coagulation.,At this point, a Frazier dissector could be passed superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally to the T11-T12 nerve roots bilaterally, and the thecal sac was noted to be decompressed both superiorly and inferiorly, and noted to be quite pulsatile.  A #4 Penfield was then used to probe the floor of the spinal canal, and no significant ventral compression remained on the thecal sac.  Copious antibiotic irrigation was used and at this point on the patient's right side, pedicle screws were placed at T11 and L1 using the technique described for a left-sided pedicle screw placement.  The anatomic landmarks being the transverse process at T11, the inferior articulating facet, and the lateral aspect of the superior articular facet for T11 and at L1, the transverse process, the junction of the intra-articular process and the facet joint.,With the screws placed on the left side, the elongated rod was removed from the patient's right side along with the locking caps, which had been placed.  It was felt that distraction was not necessary.  A 75-mm rod could be placed on the patient's left side with reattachment of the locking screw heads with the rod cap locker in place; however, it was necessary to cut a longer rod for the patient's right side with the screws slightly greater distance apart ultimately settling on a 90-mm rod.  The locking caps were placed on the right side and after all 4 locking caps were placed, the locking cap screws were tied to the cold weld.  Fluoroscopic examination demonstrated no evidence of asymmetry at the intervertebral space at T11-T12 or T12-L1 with excellent positioning of the rods and screws.  A crosslink approximately 60 mm in width was then placed between the right and left rods, and all 4 screws were tightened.,It should be noted that prior to the placement of the rods, the patient's autologous bone, which had been removed during laminectomy portion of the procedure and cleansed off soft tissue and morcellated was packed in the posterolateral space after decortication had been effected on the transverse processes at T11, T12, and L1 with AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment as well as the lateral aspects of the facet joints.  This was done bilaterally prior to placement of the rods.,Following placement of the rods as noted above, allograft bone chips were packed in addition on top of the patient's own allograft in these posterolateral gutters.  Gelfoam was used to cover the thecal sac and at this point, the wound was closed by approximating the deep muscle with 0 Vicryl suture.  The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular layer was closed with 2-0 inverted interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin approximated with staples.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications.","neurosurgery, facetectomies, decompression, posterolateral fusion, synthes click'x system, decompressive laminectomy, leksell rongeur, kerrison rongeur, transverse processes, thecal sac, nerve roots, pedicle screws, spinous process, pedicle, process, screws, rods, laminectomy, decompressive, spinous, "

She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track signs are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  The patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision was reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space was encountered.  There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The walls of the wound were explored.  There was no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she was alert.  She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.","neurosurgery, epidural hematoma, cervical spine, cervical laminectomy, central cord syndrome, acute quadriplegia, insertion of epidural drain, epidural drain, epidural space, hematoma, epidural, cervical, laminectomy, quadriplegia, "

Surgery was recommended.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Cystic suprasellar tumor.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Cystic suprasellar tumor.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , The patient was brought to operating room, underwent smooth induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, head was placed in the horseshoe head rest and positioned supine with head turned slightly towards left and slightly extended.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  With the assistance of fluoro and mapping the localization, the right nostril was infiltrated.  Dr. X will dictate the procedure of the approach.  Once the dura was visualized, there was a complex procedure secondary to the small nasal naris as well as the bony drilling that would necessitate significant drilling.  Once the operating microscope was in the field, at this point, the drilling was completed.  The dura was opened in cruciate fashion revealing normal pituitary, which was displaced and the cystic tumor.  This was then opened and using microsurgical technique with the curette suctioned and the pituitary calcifications were removed, several Valsalva maneuvers were performed without any evidence of CSF leak and trying to pull the tumor further down.  Once this was completed, there was no evidence of any bleeding.  The endoscope was then used to remove any residual fragments __________ with the arachnoid.

He was worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy.  I was consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly.  The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.  The patient was significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side.  I thought that surgery was indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, as well as to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall.  Conservative management was not an option.  The patient was preoped and consented, and was medically cleared.  I discussed the indications, risks, and benefits of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family.  The risks of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis as well as plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient.  An informed consent was obtained from the patient as such.  He was brought into the OR today for the operative procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic.  Intubation was done under C-spine precautions.  The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron.  He was hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baselines and delays.,With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area was then prepped and sterilely draped.  All the lines had been put in and the arms were padded.,Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine.  Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 was noted, lesser at C4-C5.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6.,Trimline retractors were put in, and I cut the discs out as well as removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes.,With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate as I went.  I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plates and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord.  Worst findings at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5.  Excellent thecal sac decompression was achieved and foraminal decompression was also achieved.  With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope was used for this decompressive procedure.,The patient was very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing was constant.  This was partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which was stopped only 2 days ago, and the option was not available to wait 2 to 3 weeks which would have made this man worse simply over time.  I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis.  This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case.  Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameters under control, bleeding was somewhat slow.,I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution.  These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position.  Excellent graft alignment was achieved.,I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6.  Fourteen millimeter screws were used; all the screws were tightened and torqued.  The patient's bone quality was poor, but the screws did torque appropriately.  I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and was really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French was put in with trocar.  Decision was made to start the closure.  So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staples for the skin.  A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing was applied.  The patient was extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition.,When I saw the patient in the ICU, he was awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side.  He had done well from the surgery.  Blood loss was 350 cc.  All instrument, needle, and sponge counts were correct.  No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring.  No specimens were sent.,The patient's wife was spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative findings and the expected prognosis.  The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity.  I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on.  I do not think there is need for halo rest.  We will be obtaining formal C-spine films in the morning.  Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time.",

Left temporal craniotomy.,2.  Removal of brain tumor.,OPERATING MICROSCOPE: , Stealth.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in the supine position, shoulder roll, and the head was turned to the right side.  The entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation.  Next, we made an inverted-U fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull.  A free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome.  The bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution.,The dura was then opened in an inverted-U fashion.  Using the Stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle.  We head through the vein of Labbe, and we made great care to preserve this.  We saw where the tumor almost made to the surface.  Here we made a small corticectomy using the Stealth for guidance.  We left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid.  This was submitted to pathology.  We biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology.  They gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.  With the operating microscope and Greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor.  It was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed.  We appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially.  We could see it through the ventricle.  After removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 Nurolon sutures with the piece of DuraGen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal.  The bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the Lorenz titanium plate system.  The muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin staples were used for skin closure.  The blood loss of the operation was about 200 cc.  There were no complications of the surgery per se.  The needle count, sponge count, and the cottonoid count were correct.,COMMENT:  ,Operating microscope was quite helpful in this; as we could use the light as well as the magnification to help us delineate the brain tumor - gliotic interface and while it was vague at sometimes we could I think clearly get a good cleavage plane in most instances so that we got a gross total removal of this very large and necrotic-looking tumor of the brain.","neurosurgery, temporal lobe, brain tumor, lorenz titanium plate, burr hole, cortex, corticectomy, craniotome, craniotomy, frozen section, glioblastoma multiforme, temporal craniotomy, temporoparietal, ventricle, white matter, tumor, temporal, brain,"

Right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor.,4.  Microtechniques for all the above.,5.  Stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago.  A year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation.  She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair.  Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression.  She had a consult with Radiation-Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed.  Consequently, this operation is performed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol.  She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp.  General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position.  She was well padded, secured, and so forth.  The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions.  The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint.  This was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system.  Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed.  A biparietal incision was performed.  A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation.  A biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system.  The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline.  An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor.  This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor.  The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels.  At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region.  Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled.  Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound.,Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area.  A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve.  Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull.  A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome.  A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter.  It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus.  Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum.  The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa.  Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy.,At the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly.  The tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator.  A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well.,I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter.,Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well.,The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers.  The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 Nurolon.  The dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue.  Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure.  Then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 Nylon.,For the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound.  The bone flap was brought on to the field.  The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 Nurolon.  At the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place.  The sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses.,Once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates.  The wound was then closed in layers.  The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 Nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 L.  The patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 L of Hespan and almost 3 L of crystalloid.,Nevertheless, her vitals remained stable throughout the case, and we hopefully helped her survival and her long-term neurologic status for this really nice lady.","neurosurgery, metastatic lesion, biparietal, mayfield head holder, microtechniques, stealth, craniotomy, excision, fiducial, infratentorial, parietooccipital, stereotactic, suboccipital, subtentorial, ventriculostomy, lesions to the brain, removal of the tumor, parietal occipital region, running locking nylon, biparietal craniotomy, posterior fossa, tumor, brain, dura, lesions, "

The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery.  She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins.  The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion.  Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified.  The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease.  The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use.,Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip.  Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone.  Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax.  Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure.  Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed.  The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly.  From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed.  Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use.  The bone flap was also left at the site for further use.  Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base.  Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus.  There was extensively aerated temporal bone.  At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor.  The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure.  Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone.  The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone.  Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out.  The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm.  There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well.  The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor.  The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult.  Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor.  With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem.  The eighth nerve was identified and transected.  Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem.  The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well.  It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve.  Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed.  The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus.  At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct.  The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated.  The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor.  The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face.  Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally.  However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated.  However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness.  It was released from the brainstem ventrally.  The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes.  Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume.  At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis.  The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax.  A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect.  Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal.  The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect.  Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels.  Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition.  All counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,100 mL.","neurosurgery, neuroma, bergen retractors, emissary veins, mayfield pins, acoustic, acoustic neuroma, cerebellopontine, craniotomy, facial nerve, periauricular, retrosigmoid, retrosigmoid craniotomy, internal auditory canal, porous acusticus, sigmoid sinus, auditory canal, bone, brainstem, nerve, postauricular, tumor"

The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The CUSA was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor.  Following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor.  The bone flap was elevated.  The ultrasound was then used.  The ultrasound showed the tumors directly I believe are in the interhemispheric fissure.  We noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation.  We gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile.  We then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy.  Once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely.  We then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted U fashion based on the superior side of the sinus.  After having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used.  We obtained access to the tumor.  We biopsied this and submitted it.  This was returned as a malignant brain tumor - metastatic tumor, adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer.,Following this we then debulked this tumor using CUSA and then removed it in total.  After gross total removal of this tumor, the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery.  The next step was after removal of this tumor, closure of the wound, a large piece of Duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with Lorenz plates.  The tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor, we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle.  This being the case, we left this ventricular catheter in, brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage.  The next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap.  The galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures.  The sterile dressings were applied to the scalp.  The patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation.,Once again, we performed occipital craniotomy, total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy.  The tumor was removed using the combination of CUSA, ultrasound, stealth guided-ventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today, we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa.","neurosurgery, brain tumor, cusa, occipital, adenocarcinoma, bone flap, craniotomy, malignant, metastatic, scalp galea, transverse linear incision, ventriculostomy, occipital craniotomy, tumor, stealth, brain, "

She was positioned on the operating room table in the Sugita frame with the head secured.,Using the preoperative image-guided MRI, we carefully registered the fiducials and then obtained the stereotactic image-guided localization to guide us towards the tumor.  We marked external landmarks.  Then we shaved the head over the right medial frontal area.  This area was then sterilely prepped and draped.,Evoked potential monitoring and sensory potentials were carried out throughout the case and no changes were noted.,A horseshoe shaped flap was based on the right and then brought across to the midline.  This was opened and hemostasis obtained using Raney clips.  The skin flap was retracted medially.  Two burr holes were made and were carefully connected.  One was placed right over the sinus and we carefully then removed a rectangular shaped bone flap.  Hemostasis was obtained.  Using the neuronavigation, we identified where the tumor was.  The dura was then opened based on a horseshoe flap based on the medial sinus.  We retracted this medially and carefully identified the brain.  The brain surface was discolored and obviously irritated consistent with the tumor.,We used the stereotactic neuronavigation to identify the tumor margins.,Then we used a bipolar to coagulate a thin layer of brain over the tumor.  Subsequently, we entered the tumor.  The tumor itself was extremely hard.  Specimens were taken and send for frozen section analysis, which showed probable metastatic carcinoma.,We then carefully dissected around the tumor margins.,Using the microscope, we then brought microscopic magnification and dissection into the case.  We used paddies and carefully developed microdissection planes all around the margins of the tumor superiorly, medially, inferiorly, and laterally.,Then using the Cavitron, we cored out the central part of the tumor.  Then we collapsed the tumor on itself and removed it entirely.  In this fashion, microdissection and magnification resection of the tumor was carried out.  We resected the entire tumor.  Neuronavigation was used to confirm that no further tumor residual was remained.,Hemostasis was obtained using bipolar coagulation and Gelfoam.  We also lined the cavity with Surgicel.  The cavity was nicely dry and excellent hemostasis was obtained.,The dura was closed using multiple interrupted 4-0 Nurolon sutures in a watertight fashion.  Surgicel was placed over the dural closure.  The bone flap was repositioned and held in place using CranioFIX cranial fixators.  The galea was re-approximated and the skin was closed with staples.

He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he has developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency.  He presents after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now has a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury.  His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy.  The images were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this was a left-sided condition.  He was fixed in a three-point headrest.  His scalp was shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol.  We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region.  The scalp was reflected.  A single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created.  After completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain.  The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up.  We investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline.  After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura was reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline.  We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates.  The scalp was reapproximated, and the patient was awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there was no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment.  Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.,I was present for the entire procedure and supervised this.  I confirmed prior to closing the skin that we had correct sponge and needle counts and the only foreign body was the drain.","neurosurgery, subdural, hematoma, temporal craniotomy, craniotomy, subdural space, bur hole, subdural hematoma, "

Barrel-stave osteotomies of the parietal bones.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with a roll under his shoulders and his head resting on a foam doughnut.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped with ChloraPrep.  Incision was infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 and he received antibiotics and he was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A bicoronal zigzag incision was made and Raney clips used for hemostasis.  Subcutaneous flaps were developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  These were subgaleal flaps.  Bipolar and Bovie cautery were used for hemostasis.  The craniectomy was outlined with methylene blue.  The pericranium was incised exposing the bone along the outline of the craniotomy.,Paired bur holes were drilled anteriorly and posteriorly straddling the metopic suture.  One was just above the nasion and the other was near the bregma.  Also bilateral pterional bur holes were drilled.  There was a little bit of bleeding from a tributary of the sagittal sinus anteriorly and so bone wax was used for hemostasis in all the bur holes.,The dura was separated with a #4 Penfield dissector and then the craniotomies were fashioned or cut.  I should say with the Midas Rex drill using the V5 bit and the footplate attachment, the bilateral craniotomies were cut and then the midline piece was elevated separately.  Great care was taken when removing the bone from the midline.  Bipolar cautery was used for bleeding points on the dura and especially over the sagittal sinus and the bleeding was controlled.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,The next step was to perform the orbital osteotomies with careful protection of the orbital contents.  Osteotomies were made with the Midas Rex drill using the V5 bit in the orbital roof bilaterally.  This was a very thick and vertically oriented orbital roof on each side.  Midas Rex drill and osteotomes and mallet were used to cut these osteotomies using retractors to protect the orbital contents and the dura.  The osteotomies were carried down through the tripod of the orbit and down through the lateral orbital rim and all the way down to the inferior orbital rim using the osteotome and mallet.  Bone wax was used for hemostasis.  It was necessary to score the undersurface of the bone at the midline because it was so thick and pointed.  So we were not going to be able to effect the orbital advancement without scoring the bone and thinning it out a bit.  This was done with the Midas Rex drill using B5 bit.  Also, the marked ridge just above the nasion was burred down with the Midas Rex drill.  The osteotomies were also carried down through the zygoma.  At this point, with a gentle rocking motion and sustained pressure using the osteotomes, it was then possible to carefully advance the orbital rims bilaterally, first on the right and then on the left again using just a careful rocking motion against the remaining bone to gently bend the orbital rims outward bilaterally.,Dr. X cut the bone grafts from the bone flaps and I fashioned a shelf to secure the bone graft by burring a ledge on the internal surface of the superior orbital rim.  This created a shelf for the notched bone graft to lean against basically anteriorly.  The posterior notch of the bone graft was able to be braced by the ledge of orbital roof posteriorly.,The left medial orbital rim greenstick fractured a bit, but the bone graft appeared to stay in place.,Holes were then cut in the supraorbital rim for advancement of the temporalis muscle and then a Synthes mesh was placed anteriorly using absorbable screw hardware and attached the mesh where the forehead bone flaps turned around and recontoured to make a nice bilateral forehead for Isaac.,At this point the undersurface of the temporalis muscle was scored using the Bovie cautery to allow advancement of the muscle anteriorly and we sutured it to the supraorbital rims bilaterally with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  This helped fill-in the indentation left by the orbital advancement at the temporal region.,Also, I separated the undersurface of the dura from the bone bilaterally and cut multiple barrel-stave osteotomies in the parietal bones and then greenstick fractured these barrel-staves outward to create a more normal contour of the bone slightly posteriorly.,At this point, Gelfoam had been used to protect the dura over the sagittal sinus during this part of the procedure.,The wound was then irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  Bleeding had been controlled during the procedure with Bovie and bipolar electrocautery, even so the blood loss was fairly significant adding up to about 300 or 400 mL and he received that much in packed cells and he also received a unit of fresh frozen plasma.,At this point, the reconstruction looked good.  The advancement was about 1 cm and we were pleased with the results.  The wound was irrigated and then the Gelfoam over the midline dura was left in place and the galea was then closed with #4-0 and some #3-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and #5-0 mild chromic on the skin.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.

He was rendered unconscious by the head injury.  He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi.  This workup was negative.  The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker.  The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma.  There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes.  I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity.  The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion.  There was a roll beneath the right shoulder.  The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia.  Weitlaner retractors were inserted.  A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle.  I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis.  A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm.  The bone was set aside.  The dura was clearly discolored and very tense.  The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade.  There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure.  Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity.  The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section.  The margins of the membrane were coagulated.  The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none.  The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon.  Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers.  Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL.

She fully accepted and consented to the procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  The patient was brought to the holding area and to the operating room in stable condition.  She was placed on the operating table in seated position.  Her head was shaved.  Scalp was prepped with Betadine and a Leksell frame was mounted after anesthetizing the pin sites with a 50:50 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 2% lidocaine in all planes.  IV antibiotics were administered as was the sedation.  She was then transported to the CT scan and stereotactic volumetric CT scan of the head was undertaken.  The images were then transported to the surgery planned work station where a 3-D reconstruction was performed and the target coordinates were then chosen.  Target coordinates chosen were 20 mm to the left of the AC-PC midpoint, 3 mm anterior to the AC-PC midpoint, and 4 mm below the AC-PC midpoint.  Each coordinate was then transported to the operating room as Leksell coordinates.,The patient was then placed on the operating table in a seated position once again.  Foley catheter was placed, and she was secured to the table using the Mayfield unit.  At this point then the patient's right frontal and left parietal bossings were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized using Betadine soap and paint in scrubbing fashion for 10 minutes.  Sterile drapes placed around the perimeter of the field.  This same scalp region was then anesthetized with same local anesthetic mixture.,A bifrontal incision was made as well as curvilinear incision was made over the parietal bossings.  Bur holes were created on either side of the midline just behind the coronal suture.  Hemostasis was controlled using bipolar and Bovie, and self-retaining retractors had been placed in the field.  Using the drill, then two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5-mm cutting burs and Stryker drill.  The bur holes were then curetted free, the dura cauterized, and then opened in a cruciate manner on both sides with a #11 blade.  The cortical surface was then nicked with a #11 blade on both sides as well.  The Leksell arc with right-sided coordinate was dialed in, was then secured to the frame.  Microelectrode drive was secured to the arc.  Microelectrode recording was then performed.  The signatures of the cells were recognized.  Microelectrode unit was removed.  Deep brain stimulating electrode holding unit was mounted.  The DBS electrode was then loaded into target and intraoperative programming and testing was performed.  Using the screener box and standard parameters, the patient experienced some relief of symptoms on her left side.  This electrode was secured in position using bur-hole ring and cap system.,Attention was then turned to the left side, where left-sided coordinates were dialed into the system.  The microelectrode unit was then remounted.  Microelectrode recording was then undertaken.  After multiple passes, the microelectrode unit was removed.  Deep brain stimulator electrode holding unit was mounted at the desired trajectory.  The DBS electrode was loaded into target, and intraoperative programming and testing was performed once again using the screener box.  Using standard parameters, the patient experienced similar results on her right side.  This electrode was secured using bur-hole ring and cap system.  The arc was then removed.  A subgaleal tunnel was created between the two incisions whereby distal aspect of the electrodes led through this tunnel.,We then closed the electrode, replaced subgaleally.  Copious amounts of Betadine irrigation were used.  Hemostasis was controlled using the bipolar only.  Closure was instituted using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion for the fascial layer followed by skin closure with staples.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The Leksell arc was then removed.,She was rotated into the supine position and transported to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.  All needle, sponge, cottonoid, and blade counts were correct x2 as verified by the nurses.","neurosurgery, dystonic, ac-pc, ct scan, dbs electrode, intraoperative programming, microelectrode, stereotactic, tremor, brain stimulator, craniotomy, device, dystonic tremor, electrode, frontal, screener box, target coordinate, volumetric, deep brain stimulator electrode, brain stimulator electrode, volumetric ct, stimulator, brain, "
2723, Right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage.  Status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor., Neurosurgery, Craniotomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is very well known to our service.  In brief, the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor.  He was taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach.  Intraoperatively, everything went well without any complications.  The brain at the end of the procedure was absolutely intact, but the patient developed a seizure in the Intensive Care Unit and then was taken to the CT scan, developed a second seizure.  He was given Ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  I had a long discussion immediately with Dr. X and Dr. Y.  We decided to take the patient immediately as a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  It worried me and I think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  The patient was taken as a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  The original plan was to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few weeks later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  He was taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  In the supine position, his head was put in a horseshoe without any complications.  The patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision was immediately opened.  The surgery had taken place a few hours prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  At this point, this was a life-saving procedure.  We went ahead, opened the old incision after everything was sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation was brought into place.  We went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  We immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain was moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  So I went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that was a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  So we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clots without any complication whatsoever.  We went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  The brain was very relaxed.  We had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain was very relaxed.  We irrigated thoroughly.  We identified the ventricles.  We went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with Avitene with thrombin and Gelfoam with thrombin over the next times in doing the procedure.  All this was done very well, and then we lined the cavity with Surgicel, and the Surgicel was only put at the edge and draping down as to not to leave any fragments potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything was good.  We went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  We had done a pericranial flap.  This was also put back in place and the dura was closed with 4-0 Surgilons.  We reconstructed everything.  The frontal sinus was reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  We went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of DuraGen with Hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  Once everything was confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad was put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staples without any complications.  In summary, the procedure was going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  So everything was stable.  Estimated blood loss was about 100 cubic centimeters.  The sponges and needle counts were correct.  No specimens were sent to pathology.,DISPOSITION: , The patient after this procedure was brought to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for close observation.","neurosurgery, orbitozygomatic, intracranial, brain tumor, intraparenchymal hematoma, orbitozygomatic approach, frontal lobe, intracranial hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, craniotomy, hemorrhage,"

Here, the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and then a zigzag scalp incision was made from one ear to the other ear, posterior to the coronal suture.  Scalp incision was reflected anteriorly and then the periosteum was taken off of the bone and then the temporalis muscles were reflected anterolaterally until the anterior cranial vault was exposed and then the periorbital rim, nasion and orbital part of the zygomatic arch were all dissected out as well as the pterion.  Using a craniotome, several bur holes were made; two on the either side of the midline posteriorly and then two posterolaterally.  The two posterior bur holes were then connected with a punch over the superior sagittal sinus and then the craniotome was used to fashion a flap first on the left and then on the right, going paramedian along the superior sagittal sinus in the midline and then curving over the fronto-orbital bar.  We then dissected superior sagittal sinus off of the inner table of the right bundle flap and then connected the right bundle flap going across the pterion on the right, which was abnormal.  The pterion on the right was then run short down after removing both bone flaps and then the dura was dissected off from the orbital roofs.  On the right, the orbital roof was jagged and abnormal and we had to repair a CSF leak from where the dura was punctured by the orbital roof.  The orbital rim was then dissected out and then using the saw and chisels, we were able to make the releasing cuts to free up the orbital rims, zygomatic arch and then remove the orbital bar going posteriorly and then the distal bar was split in the middle and then reapproximated with a bone graft in the middle to move the orbits out a little bit and the orbital bar was held together using absorbable plate.  It was then replaced and advanced and then relaxing, barrel-staving incisions were made in the bone flaps and the orbital rim and it was held on the right side with an absorbable plate to fix it in the proper position.  The bone flaps were then reapproximated using absorbable plates and screws, as well as #2-0 Vicryl to secure back into place.  Some of the places were also secured in the midline posteriorly, as well as off to the right where the bony defects were in place.  The periosteum was then brought over the skull and fastened in place and the temporalis muscles were tacked up to the periosteum.  The wounds were irrigated out.  A drain was left in posteriorly and then the wounds were closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the galea and fast-absorbing gut for the skin followed by sterile dressings.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and did receive blood transfusions.","neurosurgery, coronal synostosis, syndromic craniosynostosis, craniosynostosis, plagiocephaly, fronto-orbital bar, cranial vault reconstruction, cranial vault, orbital bar, orbital, cranial,"

This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters.  I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies.  The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates.  I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place.  We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side.  This was filled with bone and BMP as well.  Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws.  Following this, bleeding points were controlled and Dr. X proceeded with the closure of the abdomen.,SUMMARY: , This is a 51-year-old man who reports 15-year history of low back pain and intermittent bilateral leg pain and achiness.  He has tried multiple conservative treatments including physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, etc.  MRI scan shows a very degenerated disk at L5-S1, less so at L3-L4 and L4-L5.  A discogram was positive with the lower 3 levels, but he has pain, which starts below the iliac crest and I feel that the L3-L4 disk is probably that symptomatic.  An anterior lumbar interbody fusion was suggested.  Procedure, risks, and complications were explained.","neurosurgery, peek vertebral spacer, autograft, anterior lumbar fusion, lumbar fusion, vertebral body, vertebral spacer, vertebral, spacer, anterior, lumbar, fusion,"

The patient has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and subsequently, has been treated with pain medications, anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants.  The patient's symptoms continued to persist and subsequently, an MRI of the C-spine was done, which showed disc desiccation, spondylosis and herniated disk at C5-C6, an EMG and CV revealed a presence of mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.  The patient is now being recommended to undergo decompression and spinal instrumentation and fusion at C5-C6.  The patient understood the risks and benefits of the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Bleeding can be in the form of soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway for which she can be brought emergently back to the operating room for emergent evacuation of the hematoma as this may cause weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  This could also result in dural tear with its attendant symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and posterior neck pain as well as the development of pseudomeningocele.  Should the symptoms be severe or the pseudomeningocele be large, she can be brought back to the operating room for repair of the CSF leak and evacuation of the pseudomeningocele.  There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and nonfusion, for which she may require redo surgery at this level.  There is also the possibility of nonimprovement of her symptoms in about 10% of cases.  The patient understands this risk on top of the potential injury to the esophagus and trachea as well as the carotid artery.  There is also the risk of stroke, should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled into the right cerebral circulation.  The patient also understands that there could be hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  She understood these risks on top of the risks of anesthesia and gave her consent for the procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension and the head supported on a foam doughnut.  A marker was placed.  This verified the level to be at the C5-C6 level and incision was then marked in a transverse fashion starting from the midline extending about 5 mm beyond the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep after the head was turned 45 degrees to the left.,After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and the platysma was cut using a hot knife in a transverse fashion.  Dissection was then carried underneath the platysma superiorly inferiorly.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried out lateral to the esophagus to trachea as well as medial to the carotid sheath in the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The prevertebral fascia was noted to be taken her case with a lot of fat deposition.  Bipolar coagulation of bleeders was done; however, branch of the superior thyroid artery was ligated with Hemoclips x4.  After this was completed, a localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 level.  We proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of the C5 and C6.  Self-retaining retractor was then laid down.  An anterior osteophyte was carefully drilled using a Midas 5-mm bur and the disk together with the inferior endplate of C5 and the superior endplate of C6 was also drilled down with the Midas 5-mm bur.  This was later followed with a 3-mm bur and the disk together with posterior longitudinal ligament was removed using Kerrison's ranging from 1 to 4 mm.  The herniation was noted on the right.  However, there was significant neuroforaminal stenosis on the left.  Decompression on both sides was done and after this was completed, a Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  The area was then irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution.  A 7 mm implant with its inferior packed with Vitoss was then laid down and secured in place with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws and plate 18 mm, all of which were titanium.  X-ray after this placement showed excellent position of all these implants and screws and _____ and the patient's area was also irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution.  A round French 10 JP drain was then laid down and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The catheter was then anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch and connected to a sterile draining system.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl subcuticular 4-0 Stitch for the dermis, and the wound was reinforced with Dermabond.  Dressing was placed only at the exit site of the catheter.  C-collar was placed.  The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.",

The most recent one which I performed quite a number of years ago that was complicated by a bone flap infection and he has had removal of his bone flap.  He has been without the bone flap for a number of years now but has finally decided that he wanted to proceed with a cranioplasty.  After discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery, the decision was made to proceed with operative intervention in the form of a cranioplasty.  He had previously undergone a CT scan.  Premanufactured cranioplasty made for him that was sterile and ready to implant.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, an appropriate time out was performed.  We identified the patient, the location of surgery, the appropriate surgical procedure, and the appropriate implant.  He was given intravenous antibiotics with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Flagyl appropriately for antibiotic prophylaxis and sequential compression devices were used for deep venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.  The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A previous incision was reopened and the scalp flap was reflected forward.  We dissected off the dura and we were able to get a nice plane of dissection elevating the temporalis muscle along with the scalp flap.  We freed up the bony edges circumferentially, but except for the inferior frontal region where the vascularized pericranial graft took its vascular supply from we did not come across the base.  We did explore laterally and saw a little bit of the mesh on the lateral orbit.  Once we had the bony edges explored, we took the performed plate and secured it in a place with titanium plates and screws.  We had achieved good hemostasis.  The wound was closed in multiple layers in usual fashion over a Blake drain.  At the end of the procedure, all sponge and needle counts were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition after having tolerated the procedure well.  I was personally present and scrubbed and performed/supervised all key portions.","neurosurgery, cranial defect, frontal region, bifrontal cranioplasty, cranioplasty, chondrosarcoma, scalp flap, bony edges, bone flap, bifrontal, cranial, endotracheal, frontal,"

The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The head was placed on a well-padded head holder.  The eyes and face were protected from pressure.  A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The arms were tucked and draped to the sides.  All bony prominences were well padded.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision.  The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery.  The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided.  The midline structures were reflected to the right side.  Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected.  The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7.,The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery.  The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally.  At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely.  Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space.  All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6.  The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur.  Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs.  The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies.  Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete.  A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression.  Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment.  The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings.  The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment.,In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter.  Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone.  The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space.  The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces.  There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7.  A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position.  Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis.  The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6.  Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures.  The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws.,An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts.,Blood loss was minimal.  The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics.  The wound was inspected and judged to be dry.  The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the wound.  The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",

Operating microscope was used for both illumination and magnification.,FIRST ASSISTANT: , Nurse practitioner.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed in supine position.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior discectomy and fusion.  An incision was made midline to the anterior body of the sternocleidomastoid at C5-C6 level.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma muscle was divided exposing the carotid sheath, which was retracted laterally.  Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  After placing the self-retaining retractors with the longus colli muscles having been dissected away from the vertebral bodies at C5 and C6 and confirming our position with intraoperative x-rays, we then proceeded with the discectomy.,We then cleaned out the disc at C5-C6 after incising the annulus fibrosis.  We cleaned out the disc with a combination of angled and straight pituitary rongeurs and curettes, and the next step was to clean out the disc space totally.  With this having been done, we then turned our attention with the operating microscope to the osteophytes.  We drilled off the vertebral osteophytes at C5-C6, as well as the uncovertebral osteophytes.  This was removed along with the posterior longitudinal ligament.  After we had done this, the dural sac was opposed very nicely and both C6 nerve roots were thoroughly decompressed.  The next step after the decompression of the thecal sac and both C6 nerve roots was the fusion.  We observed that there was a ____________ in the posterior longitudinal ligament.  There was a free fragment disc, which had broken through the posterior longitudinal ligament just to the right of midline.,The next step was to obtain the bone from the back bone, using cortical cancellous graft 10 mm in size after we had estimated the size.  That was secured into place with distraction being applied on the vertebral bodies using vertebral body distractor.,After we had tapped in the bone plug, we then removed the distraction and the bone plug was fitting nicely.,We then use the Aesculap cervical titanium instrumentation with the 16-mm screws.  After securing the C5-C6 disc with four screws and titanium plate, x-rays showed good alignment of the spine, good placement of the bone graft, and after x-rays showed excellent position of the bone graft and instrumentation, we then placed in a Jackson-Pratt drain in the prevertebral space brought out through a separate incision.  The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and skin was closed with Steri-Strips.  Blood loss during the operation was less than 10 mL.  No complications of the surgery.  Needle count, sponge count, and cottonoid count were correct.,","neurosurgery, aesculap, titanium dynamic plating system, anterior cervical discectomy, herniated nucleus pulposus, cervical discectomy, operating microscope, longitudinal ligament, discectomy, anterior, instrumentation, cervical, titanium"

A prominent anterior osteophyte at C5-C6 was then localized, compared to preoperative studies in the usual fashion intraoperatively, and the osteophyte was excised with a rongeur and bony fragments saved.  This allowed for an annulotomy, which was carried out with a #11 blade and discectomy, removed with straight disc forceps portions of the disc, which were sent to Pathology for a permanent section.  Residual osteophytes and disc fragments were removed with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs as necessary as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements widely laterally as well.  A hypertrophied ligament and prominent posterior spurs were excised as well until the dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status.  At no time during the case was evidence of CSF leakage, and hemostasis was readily achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.  Once the decompression was inspected with a double ball dissector and all found to be completely decompressed, and the dura bulged at the interspace, and pulsated, then a Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and fusion putty and countersunk into position, and was quite tightly applied.  Further stability was added nonetheless with an appropriate size Uniplate, which was placed of appropriate size with appropriate size screws and these were locked into place in the usual manner.

A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues.  Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7.  Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen.  This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well.  This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed.  At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam.

The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004.  An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed.  When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there.  The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.  The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction.  She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism.  There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family.  She has no notable discomfort with this lesion.  There have been no skin changes.  Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Essentially unremarkable.

She has had no prior surgical procedures.,IMMUNIZATIONS: , Current and up to date.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,Currently taking no routine medications.  She describes her pain level currently as zero.,FAMILY HISTORY: , There is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter.  This was done in Tijuana.  His mom is from central portion of Mexico.  There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a junior at Hoover High School.  She lives with her mom in Fresno.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress.  She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.,HEENT:  The head and neck examination is most significant.  There is mild amount of facial acne.  The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.,NECK:  There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus.  A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid.  This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine.  There are some shotty adenopathy in the area.  No supraclavicular nodes were noted.,CHEST:  Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal.  There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.,ABDOMEN:  Benign.,EXTREMITIES:  Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.,GENITOURINARY:  External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.  This is same as too for her rectal examination.,SKIN:  There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.,NEUROLOGIC:  Normal and no focal deficits.  Her voice is strong and clear.  There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range.  T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal.  Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative.  There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this.  A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed.  There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease.  I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease.  During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy.  We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation.  We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well.  I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them.  I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit.  This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy.  The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case.  I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity.  All of the family's questions have been answered.  This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family.  I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done.  We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.",

The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size.  The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past.  The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.,The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses.  The foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux.  The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone.  The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx.  There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx.  The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer.  Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen.  At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx.  The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues.  Any suspicious tissue was removed.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe.  A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass.  The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule.  This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance.  It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed.  The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology.  Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC.","hematology - oncology, distal phalanx, mass, tumor., hallux bone, phalanx, symes amputation, excisional biopsy, distal, amputation, invasion, toe, symes, incision, flushed, excision, tissue, hallux"

This appears to be affixed to the underlying scalp.,PLAN: , Radical resection with frozen sections to clear margins thereafter, with planned reconstruction.,CONSENT:,  I have discussed with the patient the possible risks of bleeding, infection, renal problems, scar formation, injury to muscle, nerves, and possible need for additional surgery with possible recurrence of the patient's carcinoma, with review of detailed informed consent with the patient, who understood, and wished to proceed.,FINDINGS: , The patient had a 7cm large exophytic lesion which appeared to be invasive into the superficial table of the skull.  The final periosteal margin which centrally appeared was positive for carcinoma.  The final margins peripherally were all negative.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and there was placed supine on the operating room table.,General endotracheal anesthesia was administered after endotracheal tube intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Service personnel.  The patient was thereafter prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using Betadine Scrub and Betadine paint.  Thereafter, the local anesthesia was injected into the area around the tumor.  A **** type excision was planned down to the periosteum.  A supraperiosteal radical resection was performed.,It was obvious that there was tumor at the deep margin, involving the periosteum.  The edges were marked along the four quadrants, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and the 9 o'clock positions, and these were sent for frozen section evaluation.  Frozen section revealed positive margins at one end of the resection.  Therefore, an additional circumferential resection was performed and the final margins were all negative.,Following completion, the deep periosteal margin was resected.  The circumferential periosteal margins were noted to be negative; however, centrally, there was a small area which showed tumor eroding into the superficial cortex of the skull.  Therefore, the Midas Rex drill was utilized to resect approximately 1-2 mm of the superficial cortex of the bone at the area where the positive margin was located.  Healthy bone was obtained; however, it did not enter the diploic or marrow-containing bone in the area.  Therefore, no bong margin was taken.  However, at the end of the procedure, it did not appear that the residual bone had any residual changes consistent with carcinoma.,Following completion of the bony resection, the area was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  Thereafter, advancement flaps were created, both on the left and the right side of the scalp, with the total undermined area being approximately 18cm by 16cm.  The galea was incised in multiple areas, to provide for additional mobilization of the tissue.  The tissue was closed under tension with 3-0 Vicryl suture deep in the galea and surgical staples superficially.,The patient was awakened from anesthetic, was extubated and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient was discharged to home with antibiotics and analgesics, to follow-up in approximately one week.,NOTE: , The final margins of both periosteal, as well as skin were negative circumferentially, around the tumor.  The only positive margin was deep, which was a periosteal margin and bone underlying it was partially resected, as was indicated above.","hematology - oncology, squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp, squamous cell carcinoma, radical resection, margin, midas rex drill, radical resection of tumor, resection of tumor, endotracheal anesthesia, superficial cortex, margins, periosteum, skull, cortex, periosteal, scalp, resection, tumor, "

She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.  The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips.  The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures.  Dressing was applied and the procedure was completed.

A sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound showed evidence of a right superior parathyroid adenoma.,FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A time out was taken so that the anesthesia personnel, nursing personnel, surgical team, and patient could confirm the patient's identity, operative site and operative plan.  The electronic medical record was reviewed as was the ultrasound.  The patient was sedated.  A small roll was placed behind the shoulders to moderately hyperextend the neck.  The head was supported in a foam head cradle.  The neck and chest were prepped with chlorhexidine and isolated with sterile drapes.  After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine along the planned incision, a transverse incision was made in the skin crease a couple of centimeters above the clavicular heads and carried down through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma.  The larger anterior neck veins were divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  Superior and inferior flaps were developed in the subplatysmal plane using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  The sternohyoid muscles were separated in the midline, and the right sternohyoid muscle was retracted laterally.  The right sternothyroid muscle was divided transversely with the cautery.  The right middle thyroid vein was divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  The right thyroid lobe was rotated leftward.  Posterior to the mid portion of the left thyroid lobe, a right superior parathyroid adenoma of moderate size was identified.  This was freed up and its pedicle was ligated with small Hemoclips and divided and the gland was removed.  It was sent for weight and frozen section.  It weighed 960 mg and on frozen section was consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.,Prior to the procedure, a peripheral blood sample had been obtained and placed in a purple top tube labeled ""pre-excision.""  It was our intention to monitor intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone 10 minutes after removal of this parathyroid adenoma.  However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma was high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH.  The neck was irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory.  The sternohyoid muscles were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.  The platysma was closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery area in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.","hematology - oncology, parathyroid adenoma, superior parathyroid adenoma, excision, sestamibi parathyroid scan, sestamibi parathyroid, parathyroid scan, sternohyoid muscles, superior parathyroid, parathyroid, sestamibi, platysma, adenoma, ultrasound, sternohyoid, thyroid, muscles "

We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.,ABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain.  Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened.  Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room.  A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease.  At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation.  On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes.  The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum.  This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.  There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region.  There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease.  There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base.  There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing.  There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax.  In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor.  All other structures appeared normal.  On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed.  Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.,On further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite.

There is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.  His wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis.  They preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease.  I did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease.  Chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival.  At this point, he has an excellent functional status and I think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well.,In terms of chemotherapy, I talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to GI upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal.  I would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine.  This would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8.  This cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days.  The goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication.,In terms of staging Mr. ABCD'S had all the appropriate staging.  A PET-CT scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the CT scans that we have.,At this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain.  He will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control.  As this is the holiday weekend, I do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but I did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on Monday.  At that point, we will get him in and I will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy.,Thank you very much for this interesting consult.",

The submandibular gland was removed as well.  The X, XI, and XII cranial nerves were preserved.  The internal jugular vein and carotid artery were preserved as well.  Copious irrigation of the wound bed showed no identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  There were two obviously positive nodes in this neck dissection.  One was left medial neck just lateral to the previous tracheal dissection and one was in the mid region of zone 2.  A #10 flat fluted Blake drain was placed through a separate stab incision and it was secured to the skin with a 2-0 silk ligature.  The wound was closed in layers using a 3-0 Vicryl in a buried knot interrupted fashion for the subcutaneous tissue and the skin was closed with staples.  A fluff and Kling pressure dressing was then applied.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.","hematology - oncology, metastatic papillary cancer, thyroidectomy, thyroid cancer, papillary cell type, dissection, neck, metastatic, paratracheal, papillary, cancer"
3135, A very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer.  , Hematology - Oncology, Metastatic Ovarian Cancer - Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Metastatic ovarian cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic.  She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month.  She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000.  Her ANC was 0.5.  She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots.  She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.,Over the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily.  Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions.  She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fevers or chills.  However, she was complaining of chest pain.  She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it was nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.  There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox.  There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.,At this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY,1.

He was presented at Tumor Board where it was thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma.  Thus, he was offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure.  He wished to proceed, so he was brought to the operating room.,An epidural catheter was placed.  He was put in a supine position where SCDs and Foley catheter were placed.  He was put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  He was given preoperative antibiotics, then he was placed in the left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace was made using the skin knife and then Bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the Alexander instrument, the chest was entered.  Upon entering the chest, the chest wall retractor was inserted and the cavity inspected.  It appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and was involving the diaphragm.  He also had some marked lymphadenopathy.  With these findings, which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma, we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection.  Thus, we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly.  We also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the arteries going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar arteries as well as the artery going to the right middle lobe.  The posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a GIA stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 2-0 ties.  Once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy, we were able to pass a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment.  This was ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 3-0 silk.  This was divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe.  This was also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated.  Care was taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobe.,We then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein.  The superior pulmonary vein was visualized as well.  The right angle was passed around the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was ligated in continuity with 2-0 silk and a 3-0 stick tie.  Upon division of this portion, the specimen site had some bleeding, which was eventually controlled using several 3-0 silk sutures.  The bronchial anatomy was defined.  Next, we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe as well as the right middle lobe.  A TA-30 4.8 stapler was then closed.  The lung insufflated.  The right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well.  The stapler was fired, and the bronchus was cut with a 10-blade.,We then turned our attention to the diaphragm.  There was a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm has involved with tumor, and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin.  Upon going through the diaphragm, it became clear that the tumor was also involving the dome of the liver, so after going around the diaphragm in its entirety, we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that was involved.  It seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion.  The Bovie was set to high cautery.  The capsule was entered, and then using Bovie cautery, we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver.  It did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver.  Hemostasis was achieved with Bovie cautery and gentle pressure.  The specimen was then taken off the table and sent to Pathology for permanent.  The area was inspected for hemostasis.  A 10-flat JP was placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection, and 0 Prolene was used to close the diaphragmatic defect, which was under very little tension.  A single 32 straight chest tube was also placed.  The lung was seen to expand.  We also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobes would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe.  Hemostasis was observed at the end of the case.  The chest tube was irrigated with sterile water, and there was no air leak observed from the bronchial stump.  The chest was then closed with Vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscles, staying above the ribs.  The 2-0 Vicryl was used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer, and 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin.  The patient was then brought to supine position, extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.,Dr. X was present for the entirety of the procedure, which was a right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and a portion of liver.","hematology - oncology, double lumen endotracheal, en bloc resection, malignant mesothelioma, lung mass, endotracheal tube, chest tube, bovie cautery, en bloc, diaphragm, lobectomy, mesothelioma, thoracotomy, "

Left neck mass biopsy.,2.  Selective surgical neck dissection, left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Preoperative antibiotic was given and Dr. X proceeded to intubate the patient after a detailed anesthetic preparation that started in the Same Day Surgery and followed in the operating room.  Finally, a 5.5-French endotracheal tube was inserted and the patient was able to tolerate that and did have stable vital signs and a proper oxygenation.,Then, the patient was positioned with the neck slightly distended and turned toward the opposite side of the operation.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  I proceeded to mark the site of the mass and then also to mark the proposed site for the creation of a flap.  Then, I performed an extensive anesthetic block of the area.,Then, an incision was made along the area marked for development of the flap, but in a very limited extent, just to expose the cervical mass.  The cervical mass, which was about 4 cm in diameter and very firm and rubbery, was found lodged between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein in the area III of the neck.  A wedge sample was sent to Pathology for frozen section.  At the same time, we waited for the result and the initial report was not clear in the sense that a lot of lymphoepithelial reaction was seen.  Therefore, a larger sample was sent to Pathology and at that particular time, the fresh frozen was reported as having squamous elements.  This was not totally clear in my mind and therefore I proceeded to excise the full mass, which luckily was not attached to any structures except in the very deep surface.  There, there were some attachments to branches of the external carotid artery, which had to be suture ligated.  At any rate, the whole specimen was to the lab and finally the diagnosis was that of a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.,With that information in hand, we proceeded to continue with a neck dissection and proceeded to make an incision along the previously marked sites of the flap, which basically involved a reverse U shape on the left neck.  This worked out quite nicely.  The external jugular vein was out of the way, so initially we did not deal with it.  We proceeded to tackle the area III and extended into II-A.  When we excised the mass, the upper end was in intimate relationship with the parotid gland, which was relatively large in this patient, but it looked normal otherwise.  Also, I felt that the submaxillary gland was enlarged.  At any rate, we decided to clean up the areas III and IV and a few nodes from II-A that were removed, and then we went into the posterior triangle where we identified the spinal accessory nerve, which we protected, actually did not even dissect close to it.,The same nerve had been already identified anterior to the internal jugular vein, very proximally behind the digastric and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  At any rate, there were large nodes in the posterior triangle, in areas V-A and V-B, which were excised and sent to Pathology for examination.  Also, there was a remnant of a capsule of the main mass that we proceeded to excise and sent to Pathology as an extra specimen.  Hemostasis was revised and found to be adequate.  The flaps had been protected by folding it to the chest and protected by wet sponges on both sides of the flap.  The flap was replaced in its position.  A soft Jackson-Pratt catheter was left in the area, and then we proceeded to approximate the flap with a number of subcutaneous sutures of Vicryl and then running sutures of subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  I would like to mention that also the facial vein was excised and the external jugular vein was ligated.  It was in very lateral location and it was on the site of the drain, so we ligated that but did not excise it.  A pressure dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was no more than 100 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and sent for recovery.","hematology - oncology, neck mass biopsy, surgical neck dissection, internal jugular vein, external jugular vein, squamous cell carcinoma, neck mass, malignant mass, neck dissection, mass, neck, wedge, vein,"

Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed.  SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol.  The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion.  At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery.  The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site.  Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules.  An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion.  The effusion was then drained with a sucker.  Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura.  Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease.  This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization.  After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc.  The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well.  A 32 curved chest tube chest tube was placed and secured with nylon.  The other port site was closed at the level of the fascia with 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for the skin.

3145," Newly diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia; extensive deep vein thrombosis, and pharmacologic thrombolysis following placement of a vena caval filter.", Hematology - Oncology, Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Consult ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Newly diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia; extensive deep vein thrombosis, right iliac vein and inferior vena cava (IVC), status post balloon angioplasty, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis following placement of a vena caval filter.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient was transferred here the evening of 02/23/2007 from Hospital with a new diagnosis of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on confirmation by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphoblasts that afternoon.  History related to this illness probably dates back to October of 2006 when he had onset of swelling and discomfort in the left testicle with what he described as a residual ""lump"" posteriorly.  The left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since.  In early November, he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg, which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain.  Physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved.  In December, he noted onset of increasing fatigue.  He used to work out regularly, lifting lifts, doing abdominal exercises, and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities.  He has lost 10 pounds since December and feels his appetite has decreased.  Night sweats and cough began in December, for which he was treated with a course of Augmentin.  However, both of these problems have continued.  He also began taking Accutane for persistent acne in December (this agent was stopped on 02/19/2007).  Despite increasing fatigue and lethargy, he continues his studies at University of Denver, has a biology major (he aspires to be an ophthalmologist).,The morning of 02/19/2007, he awakened with severe right inguinal and right lower quadrant pain.  He was seen in Emergency Room where it was noted that he had an elevated WBC of 18,000.  CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to rule out possible appendicitis and on that CT, a large clot in the inferior vena cava extending to the right iliac and femoral veins was found.  He promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis.  Repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued.  Because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected.  Appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a PET/CT scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation.  This study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity.  Because the WBC continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, Sheryl Asplund, M.D., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood.  These studies became available the afternoon of 02/23/2007, and confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  The patient was transferred here after stopping of the continuous infusion heparin and receiving a dose of Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously for further diagnostic evaluation and management of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).,ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

The patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion.", Hematology - Oncology, Lung Cancer & MI - Hospice Cosult ,"REASON FOR CONSULT: , I was asked to see this patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, on hospice with inferior ST-elevation MI.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion.  Her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom I had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month.  The patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m.  At about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements.  Her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve.  Then, she began vomiting.  When the patient's daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes.,She came to the emergency room, an EKG showed inferior ST-elevation MI.  I was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, I felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with PCI/CABG.  She was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free.  Repeat EKG shows normalization of her ST elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.  In early-to-mid December, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage.  We did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion.  She is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple CVA.,MEDICATIONS: , Medications as an outpatient:,1.  Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.,2.  Roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain.,ALLERGIES:  ,CODEINE.  NO SHRIMP, SEAFOOD, OR DYE ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative for cardiac disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes.  She uses alcohol.  No use of illicit drugs.  She is divorced and lives with her daughter.  She is a retired medical librarian from Florida.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Unable to be obtained due to the patient's aphasia.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22.  O2 saturation 100%.  On general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has dry mucosal membrane.  She now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new.  Neck veins are not distended.  No carotid bruits visible.  Skin:  Warm, well perfused.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2, regular rate.  No significant murmurs.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  Extremities:  Without edema, on limited exam.  Neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop.,DIAGNOSTIC/LABORATORY DATA: , EKGs as reviewed above.  Her last ECG shows normalization of prior ST elevation in the inferior leads with Q waves and first-degree AV block, PR interval 280 milliseconds.  Further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, INR 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179.,Chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized.  I will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.,2.  Morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.,3.  Would avoid other blood thinners including Plavix, Integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion.,Other management as per the medical service.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X of the hospitalist service who will be admitting the patient.",

The mass increased in size and she was seen by her primary care physician and referred to orthopedic surgeon.  MRI showed inflammation and was thought to be secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.  The mass increased in size.  She eventually underwent a partial resection found to have pathologic grade 2 leiomyosarcoma, margins were impossible to assess, but were likely positive.  She was evaluated by Dr. X and Dr. Y and a decision was made to proceed with preoperative chemotherapy.  She began treatment with CIVI-CAD in December 2007.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, and subdural hematoma while on anticoagulation.  She eventually underwent surgical resection on May 1, 2008 with small area of residual disease, but otherwise clear margins.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,1.

The patient has received prior intravenous chemotherapy.  Due to some increasing renal insufficiency and difficulties with hydration, it was elected to change her to intraperitoneal therapy.  She had her first course with intraperitoneal cisplatin, which was very difficultly tolerated by her.  Therefore, on the last hospitalization for IP chemo, she was switched to Taxol.  The patient since her last visit has done relatively well.  She had no acute problems and has basically only chronic difficulties.  She has had some decrease in her appetite, although her weight has been stable.  She has had no fever, chills, or sweats.  Activity remains good and she has continued difficulty with depression associated with type 1 bipolar disease.  She had a recent CT scan of the chest and abdomen.  The report showed the following findings.  In the chest, there was a small hiatal hernia and a calcification in the region of the mitral valve.  There was one mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph node.  Several areas of ground-glass opacity were noted in the lower lungs, which were subtle and nonspecific.  No pulmonary masses were noted.  In the abdomen, there were no abnormalities of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and left adrenal gland.  On the right adrenal gland, a 17 x 13 mm right adrenal adenoma was noted.  There were some bilateral renal masses present, which were not optimally evaluated due to noncontrast study.  A hyperdense focus in the lower pole of the left kidney was felt to most probably represent a hemorrhagic renal cyst.  It was unchanged from February and measured 9 mm.  There was again minimal left pelvic/iliac _______ with right and left peritoneal catheters noted and were unremarkable.  Mesenteric nodes were seen, which were similar in appearance to the previous study that was felt somewhat more conspicuous due to opacified bowel adjacent to them.  There was a conglomerate omental mass, which had decreased in volume when compared to previous study, now measuring 8.4 x 1.6 cm.  In the pelvis, there was a small amount of ascites in the right pelvis extending from the inferior right paracolic gutter.

The treatment planning process requires at least 4 hours of physician time.  The technology is appropriate in this patient's case due to the fact that the target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures.  Sequential CT scans are obtained and transferred to the treatment planning software.  Extensive analysis occurs.  The target volumes, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected.  In addition, organs at risk are outlined.  Doses are selected both for targets, as well as for organs at risk.  Associated dose constraints are placed.  Inverse treatment planning is then performed in conjunction with the physics staff.  These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician.  Multiple beam arrangements may be tested for appropriateness and optimal dose delivery in order to maximize the chance of controlling disease, while minimizing exposure to organs at risk.  This is performed in hopes of minimizing associated complications.  The physician delineates the treatment type, number of fractions and total volume.  During the time of treatment, there is extensive physician intervention, monitoring the patient set up and tolerance.  In addition, specific QA is performed by the physics staff under the physician's direction.,In view of the above, the special procedure code 77470 is deemed appropriate.","hematology - oncology, multiple beam arrangements, intensity modulated radiation therapyNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

We corrected her hematocrit last year with intravenous (IV) iron.  Ultimately, she had a total proctocolectomy done on 03/14/2007 to treat her colitis.  Her course has been very complicated since then with needing multiple surgeries for removal of hematoma.  This is partly because she was on anticoagulation for a right arm deep venous thrombosis (DVT) she had early this year, complicated by septic phlebitis.,Chart was reviewed, and I will not reiterate her complex history.,I am asked to see the patient again because of concerns for coagulopathy.,She had surgery again last month to evacuate a pelvic hematoma, and was found to have vancomycin resistant enterococcus, for which she is on multiple antibiotics and followed by infectious disease now.,She is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as well.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Labs today showed a white blood count of 7.9, hemoglobin 11.0, hematocrit 32.8, and platelets 1,121,000.  MCV is 89.  Her platelets have been elevated for at least the past week, with counts initially at the 600,000 to 700,000 range and in the last couple of day rising above 1,000,000.  Her hematocrit has been essentially stable for the past month or so.  White blood count has improved.,PT has been markedly elevated and today is 44.9 with an INR of 5.0.  This is despite stopping Coumadin on 05/31/2007, and with administration of vitamin K via the TPN, as well as additional doses IV.  The PT is slightly improved over the last few days, being high at 65.0 with an INR of 7.3 yesterday.,PTT has not been checked since 05/18/2007 and was normal then at 28.,LFTs have been elevated.  ALT is 100, AST 57, GGT 226, alkaline phosphatase 505, albumin low at 3.3, uric acid high at 4.9, bilirubin normal, LDH normal, and pre-albumin low at 16.  Creatinine is at 1.5, with an estimated creatinine clearance low at 41.7.  Other electrolytes are fairly normal.,B12 was assessed on 05/19/2007 and was normal at 941.  Folic acid was normal.  Iron saturation has not been checked since March, and was normal then.

I will check mixing studies to see if she has deficiency, which could be due to poor production given her elevated LFTs, decreased albumin, and decreased pre-albumin.,It is possible that she has an inhibitor, which would have to be an acquired inhibitor, generally presenting with an elevated PTT and not PT.  I will check a PTT and check mixing studies if that is prolonged.  It is doubtful that she has a lupus anticoagulant since she has been presenting with bleeding symptoms rather than clotting.  I agree with continuing off of anticoagulation for now.,She has markedly elevated platelet count.  I suspect this is likely reactive to infection, and not from a new myeloproliferative disorder.,Anemia has been stable, and is multifactorial.  Given her decreased creatinine clearance, I agree with erythropoietin support.  She was iron deficient last year, and with her multiple surgeries and poor p.o. intake, may have become iron deficient again.  She has had part of her small bowel removed, so there may be a component of poor absorption as well.  If she is iron deficient, this may contribute also to her elevated platelet counts.  I will check a ferritin.  This may be difficult to interpret because of inflammation.  If it is decreased, plan will be to add iron supplementation intravenously.  If it is elevated, we could consider a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate her iron stores, and also assess her myelopoiesis given the markedly elevated platelet counts.,She needs continued treatment as you are for her infections.,I will discuss the case with Dr. X as well since there is a question as to whether she might need additional surgery.  She is not a surgical candidate now with her elevated PT/INR.",

At this time, she is being treated aggressively with mechanical ventilation and other supportive measures and has developed disseminated intravascular coagulation with prolonged partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer.  At this time, I am being consulted for further evaluation and recommendations for treatment.  The nurses report that she has actually improved clinically over the last 24 hours.

The chemotherapy is given in addition to the radiotherapy, not only to act as a cytotoxic agent on its own, but also to potentiate and enhance the effect of radiotherapy on tumor cells.  It has been shown in the literature that this will maximize the chance of control.,During the course of the treatment, the patient's therapy must be closely monitored by the attending physician to be sure that the proper chemotherapy drugs are given at the proper time during the radiotherapy course.  It is also important to closely monitor the patient to know when treatment with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy needs to be held.  This combined treatment usually produces greater side effects than either treatment alone, and these need to be constantly monitored and treatment initiated on a timely basis to minimize these effects.  In accordance, this requires more frequency consultation and coordination with the medical oncologist.  Therefore, this becomes a very time intensive treatment and justifies CPT Code 77470.","hematology - oncology, tumor cells, concomitant chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapyNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

This patient is undergoing a conformal simulation as the method to precisely define the area of disease which needs to be treated. , Hematology - Oncology, Conformal Simulation ,"CONFORMAL SIMULATION WITH COPLANAR BEAMS,This patient is undergoing a conformal simulation as the method to precisely define the area of disease which needs to be treated.  It allows us to highly focus the beam of radiation and shape the beam to the target volume, delivering a homogenous dosage through it while sparing the surrounding, more radiosensitive, normal tissues.  This will allow us to give the optimum chance of tumor control while minimizing the acute and long-term side effects.,A conformal simulation is a simulation which involves extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist time and effort.  The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room, where appropriate markers are placed, and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  One then approximates the field sizes and arrangements (gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields).  Radiographs are taken, and these fields are marked on the patient's skin.  The patient is then transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table.  Scans are then performed through the targeted area.  The CT scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist, and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on each slice of the CT scan.  The dosimetrist then evaluates each individual slice in the treatment planning computer with the appropriately marked structures.  This volume is then reconstructed in 3-dimensional space.  Utilizing the beam's-eye view features, the appropriate blocks are designed.  Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide homogenous coverage of the target volume while minimizing the dose to normal structures.  Once all appropriate beam parameters and isodate distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, each individual slice is then reviewed by the physician.  The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  Once these are approved, Cerrobend blocks will be custom fabricated.,If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where the computer-designed fields are re-simulated.","hematology - oncology, coplanar beams, ct scan, target volume, conformal simulation, beamsNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

She did not tolerate the tamoxifen and therefore when I saw her on 11/23/09, she decided that she would take no further antiestrogen therapy.  She met with me again on 02/22/10, and decided she wants to rechallenge herself with tamoxifen.  When I saw her on 04/28/10, she was really doing quite well with tamoxifen.  She tells me 2 weeks after that visit, she developed toxicity from the tamoxifen and therefore stopped it herself.  She is not going take to any further tamoxifen.,Overall, she is feeling well.

Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.", Hematology - Oncology, Colon Cancer Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007.  At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy.  Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks.  She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007.  She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y.  Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.,On colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure.  She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion.  Pathology showed a colon cancer, although I do not have a copy of that report at this time.,She had surgical resection done yesterday.  The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis.  At the time of surgery, lymph nodes were palpable.,Pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm, circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm, 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis.  There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted.  Radial margin was 0.1 mm.  Other margins were 5 and 6 mm.  Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.,Staging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs.  The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1.  The ovaries were normal.  An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She has otherwise been feeling well.  She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy.  She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber.  She was eating well up until the time of her surgery.  She is up-to-date on mammography, which will be due again in June.  She has no history of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, thyroid, or central nervous system (CNS) disease.,ALLERGIES: , PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSED HIVES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.,MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:,  None.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , No significant medical problem.  She has had three miscarriages, all of them at about seven weeks.  She has no prior surgeries.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She smoked cigarettes socially while in her 20s.  A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week.  She does not smoke now.  She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine.  She is married and has no children.  An IUD was recently placed.  She works as an esthetician.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45.  This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history.  She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early.  Her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44.  Another brother is aged 52 and he had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago.  Otherwise, he has no medical problem.  Mother is aged 82 and healthy.  She was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , ,GENERAL:  She is in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile with a pulse of 78, respirations 16, blood pressure 124/70, and pulse oximetry is 93% on 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.,SKIN:  Warm and dry.

Sodium is 136, potassium 4.1, bicarb 25, chloride 104, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7, and glucose is 133.  Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1.  She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled.  Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.,A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis.  Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy.  I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age.  Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit.  Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.,Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects.  We did not review all that information today.,She has a family history of early colon cancer.  Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can.  Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available.  She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy.  She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission.  I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed.  If not, those can be drawn tomorrow.",

", Ophthalmology, Vitrectomy - 3 ,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.

She has no exposure to tuberculosis or syphilis, she has no mouth or genital ulcers.  She has no skin rashes.  She has no connective tissue disorders.,PAST OCULAR HISTORY: , Significant for cataract and glaucoma surgery of the right eye.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, visual acuity measures hand motions on the right and 20/25 in the left.  There is an afferent pupillary defect on the right.  On examination, there is a right hypertropia.  There is dense anterior chamber inflammation on the right eye with a stagnant aqueous.  There is either neovascularization on the iris or reactive iris vessels, it is difficult to discern.  This seems to be complete iris synechia to the anterior lens capsule.  There is a posterior chamber intraocular lens with an inflammatory debris on the anterior surface.  The anterior chamber appears narrow.  On the left, there is also dense inflammation at 4+ cell.  There is 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  Dilated fundus examination cannot be performed on the right secondary to intense inflammation.  On the left, there is no evidence of active posterior uveitis.  There is some inferior vitreous debris.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,  Chronic bilateral recurrent nongranulomatous diffuse uveitis.  Currently, there is very severe right eye inflammation and severe left eye.  I discussed at length with the patient that this will likely take an oral steroid to quite her down.  Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroids at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte as well as atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.  I am sending a copy of this dictation to her primary care doctor, she said she has had a negative HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, and ANA in the past.  At this stage, to be thorough I would ask Dr. X to assist us in repeating her chest x-ray, PPD if not current, and an RPR.  Additionally, in anticipation of need for methotrexate, it would be helpful to have a full liver function profile as well as hepatitis B and hepatitis C.","ophthalmology, iritis, nongranulomatous, uveitis, eye inflammation, photophobia, recurrent nongranulomatous anterior iritis, headache and photophobia, anterior chamber, anterior, chamber, inflammation, "

In the preoperative area, the patient received pilocarpine drops.  The patient received IV propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were given.  The operative eye then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lids, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A screw type speculum was inserted to maintain patency of lids.  A 6-0 Vicryl suture was placed through the superior cornea, and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior conjunctiva.  A peritomy was performed approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to the limbus and this flap was dissected forward to the cornea.  All Tenons were removed from the overlying sclera and the area was treated with wet-field cautery to achieve hemostasis.  A 2 mm x 3 mm scleral flap was then outlined with a Micro-Sharp blade.  This was approximately one-half scleral depth in thickness.  A crescent blade was then used to dissect forward the clear cornea.  Hemostasis was again achieved with wet-field cautery.  A Weck-Cel sponge tip soaked in mitomycin was then placed under the conjunctival and tenon flap and left there for two minutes.  The site was then profusely irrigated with balanced salt solution.  A paracentesis wound was made temporarily and then the Micro-Sharp blade was used to enter the anterior chamber at the anterior most margin of the trabeculectomy bed.  A Kelly-Descemet punch was then inserted, and a trabeculectomy was performed.  Iris was withdrawn through the trabeculectomy site and a peripheral iridectomy was performed using Vannas scissors and 0.12 forceps.  The iris was then repositioned into the eye and the anterior chamber was inflated with BSS.  The scleral flap was sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures with knots trimmed, rotated, and buried.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture on a BV needle.  BSS was irrigated in the anterior chamber and the blood was noted to elevate nicely without leakage.  Antibiotic and steroid drops were placed in the eye as was homatropine 5%.  The antibiotic consisted of Vigamox and the steroid was Econopred Plus.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after the drape was removed.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon was burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure was felt to be adequate. The speculum was removed.

Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed.

All of their questions were answered.  Informed consent was signed.  The patient was brought into the operating room.  A surgical time-out was performed during which all members of the operating room staff agreed upon the patient's name, operation to be performed, and correct operative eye.  After administration of general anesthesia, the patient was intubated without incident.,The right eye was prepared and draped in the usual fashion for ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was used to separate the eyelids of the left eye.  A 9 o'clock anterior chamber paracentesis was created with Supersharp blade and the anterior chamber was filled with Healon.  The clear corneal incision was superior to the visual axis and was closed with three interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures with the knots buried.  A standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy __________ was initiated by performing partial conjunctival peritomies in the superonasal, superotemporal, and inferotemporal quadrants with Westcott scissors.  Hemostasis was achieved with bipolar cautery.  A 7-0 Vicryl suture was preplaced in the mattress fashion, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.  A microvitreoretinal blade was used to create a sclerotomy at this site and a 4-mm infusion cannula was introduced through the sclerotomy and tied in place with the aforementioned suture.  The presence of the tip of the cannula was confirmed to be within the vitreous cavity prior to initiation of posterior infusion.  Two additional sclerotomies were created superonasally and superotemporally, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus with microvitreoretinal blade.,The vitreous cutter was used to perform the pars plana lens actively preserving peripheral anterior capsule.  The pars plana vitrectomy was performed with the assistance of the BIOM non-contact lens indirect viewing system using the light pipe illuminator and the vitreous cutter.  The vitreous was trimmed to the vitreous base.  A posterior vitreous detachment was created and extended 360 degrees with the assistance of triamcinolone for staining.,The foreign body appeared to exit the posterior pole along the superotemporal arcade and apparently severed a branched retinal artery resulting in an area of macular ischemia with retinal whitening along its course.  The exit wound was explored.  No intraocular foreign body or mural foreign body was observed with the assistance of intraocular forceps.  The intraocular magnet was then inserted through the sclerotomy and no foreign body was again identified.,An air-fluid exchange was performed with the assistance of the soft-tip extrusion cannula and the retinal periphery was examined with scleral depression.  No retinal breaks or defects were noted in the periphery.  The plugs were placed in the sclerotomies and the conjunctival peritomy was extended at 360 degrees.  Each of the rectus muscles was isolated on a 2-0 silk suture and a #XXX band was threaded beneath each of the rectus muscle and fixed to itself in the inferonasal quadrant with the Watzke sleeve.  The buckle was sutured to the eye wall with 5-0 Mersilene sutures in each quadrant in a mattress fashion.  The buckle was trimmed and the height of the buckle was inspected internally and noted to be adequate.,Residual intraocular fluid was removed with a soft-tip extrusion cannula and the sclerotomies were closed with 7-0 Vicryl sutures.  A 12% concentration of C3F8 gas was flushed through the eye.  The infusion cannula was removed and the sclerotomy was closed with the preplaced 7-0 Vicryl suture.  All of the sclerotomies were noted to be airtight.  The intraocular pressure following injection of 0.05 mL each of vancomycin (0.5 mg) and ceftazidime (1 mg) were injected through the superotemporal pars plana, 30-gauge needles.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut sutures with the knots buried.  Subconjunctival injections of Ancef and Decadron were delivered inferotemporally.  The lid speculum was removed.  Pred-G ointment and atropine solution were applied to the ocular surface.  The eye was patched and shielded, and the patient was returned to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,I was the attending surgeon, was present and scrubbed for the entirety of the procedure.",

(S)he was taken to the operating room and sedated via IV sedation. 2% lidocaine jelly was placed in the XXX eye (or, retrobulbar anesthesia was performed using a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% marcaine). The XXX eye was prepped using a 10% Betadine solution. (S)he was covered in sterile drapes leaving only the XXX eye exposed. A Lieberman lid speculum was placed to provide exposure. The Thornton fixation ring and a Superblade were used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 (or 11 depending upon side and handedness, and assuming superior incision) o'clock. Then 1% lidocaine was injected through the paracentesis. After the nonpreserved lidocaine was injected, Viscoat was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The Thornton fixation ring and a 2.75 mm keratome blade were used to create a two-step full-thickness clear corneal incision superiorly. The cystitome and Utrata forceps were used to create a continuous capsulorrhexis in the anterior lens capsule. BSS on a hydrodissection cannula was used to perform gentle hydrodissection. Phacoemulsification was then performed to remove the nucleus. I & A was performed to remove the remaining cortical material. Provisc was injected to fill the capsular bag and anterior chamber. A XXX diopter SN60AT (for Acrysof natural lens) intraocular lens was injected into the capsular bag. The Kuglen hook was used to rotate it into proper position in the capsular bag.

Complete refractive work-up., Ophthalmology, Optometry - Letter ,"RE:  Sample Patient,Dear Dr. Sample:,Sample Patient was seen at the Vision Rehabilitation Institute on Month DD, YYYY.  She is an 87-year-old woman with a history of macular degeneration, who admits to having PDT therapy within the last year.  She would like to get started with some vision therapy so that she may be able to perform her everyday household chores, as well as reading small print.  At this time, she uses a small handheld magnifier, which is providing her with only limited help.,A complete refractive work-up was performed today, in which we found a mild change in her distance correction, which allowed her the ability to see 20/70 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left eye.  With a pair of +4 reading glasses, she was able to read 0.5M print quite nicely.  I have loaned her a pair of +4 reading glasses at this time and we have started her with fine-detailed reading.  She will return to our office in a matter of two weeks and we will make a better determination on what near reading glasses to prescribe for her.  I think that she is an excellent candidate for low vision help.  I am sure that we can be of great help to her in the near future.,Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient.,With best regards,,Sample Doctor, O.D.","ophthalmology, optometry, letter, optometry letter, pdt therapy, distance correction, macular degeneration, reading glasses, vision therapy, complete refractive, macular, degeneration,"
2415, Patient being referred for evaluation of glaucoma., Ophthalmology, Ophthalmology - Letter - 2 ,"XYZ, O.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear Dr. XYZ:,Thank you for your kind referral for patient ABC.  Mr. ABC is being referred for evaluation of glaucoma.  The patient states he has no visual complaints.,On examination, the patient's visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally.  The patient's visual fields are full to confrontation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect and applanation pressures are 15 mmHg bilaterally.  On slit lamp examination, the patient has a normal anterior segment with 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  On dilated examination, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye of 0.4.  Macula, vessels, and periphery were within normal limits.  On the left eye, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 and macula vessels and periphery are also within normal limits.  On gonioscopy, the patient shows deep anterior chamber angle OU and is open to the ciliary body band 360 degrees.,In conclusion, my initial impression is that Mr. ABC does not have glaucoma.  He has fairly symmetric and small cup-to-disc ratios OU.  His intraocular pressures were within normal limits in our office today.  I discussed at length with him the alternatives of observation versus continued work-up and testing.  He seemed to understand very well and went with my recommendation to continue observation for now.  We will take fundus photos of his optic nerves for future comparison, but I think given the lack of any strong findings suspicious for glaucoma, we will defer further testing at this time.,Should you have any specific questions or any other information that you think that I may not have included in this evaluation, please feel free to contact me.  I have recommended him to follow up with you for continued examination, continued check-ups, and should you find any other abnormal findings, I would be happy to address those again.,Again, thank you for your referral of Mr. ABC.,Sincerely,,","ophthalmology, cup to disc ratio, referred for evaluation, cup to disc, disc ratio, macula vessels, pressures, eye, macula, vessels, visual, cup, disc, glaucoma, examination, intact, "
2416, Patient referred for narrow angles and possible associated glaucoma., Ophthalmology, Ophthalmology - Letter - 3 ,"XYZ, O.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear XYZ:,Thank you very much for your kind referral of Mrs. ABC who you referred to me for narrow angles and possible associated glaucoma.  I examined Mrs. ABC initially on MM/DD/YYYY.  At that time, she expressed a chief concern of occasional pain around her eye, but denied any flashing lights, floaters, halos, or true brow ache.  She reports a family history of glaucoma in her mother, but is unsure of the specific kind.  Her past ocular history has been fairly unremarkable.  As you know, she has a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes.  She is unaware of her last hemoglobin A1c levels, but reports a blood sugar of 158 taken on the morning of her appointment with me.  She is followed by Dr. X here locally.,Upon examination, her visual acuity measured 20/20-1 in either eye with her glasses.  Presenting intraocular pressures were14 mmHg in either eye at 2:03 p.m.  Pupillary reactions, confrontational visual fields, and ocular motility were normal.  The slit lamp exam revealed narrow anterior chambers and on gonioscopy only the buried anterior trabecular meshwork was visible in either eye, but the angle deepened with gonio-compression suggesting appositional and not synechial closure.  I deferred the dilated portion of the exam on that day.,We proceeded with peripheral iridectomies and following this upon her most recent visit on MM/DD/YYYY, I was able to safely dilate her eyes as her chambers had deepened and the PIs were patent.  I note that she has an increased CD ratio measuring 0.65 in the right eye and 0.7 in the left and although her FDT visual fields and GDX testing were normal at your office, she does have an enlarged blind spot in either eye on Humphrey visual fields and retinal tomography also shows some suspicious changes.  Therefore, I feel she has sustained some optic nerve damage perhaps from intermittent angle closure in the past.,In summary, Mrs. ABC has a history of narrow angles not successfully treated with laser PIs.  Her intraocular pressures have remained stable.  I will continue to monitor her closely.,Thank you very much once again for allowing me to have shared in her care.  If I can provide any additional information or be of further service, do let me know.,Sincerely,,","ophthalmology, intraocular pressures, narrow angles, visual fields, angles, intraocular, pressures, anterior, chambers, gonioscopy, glaucoma, narrow, visual, eye, "

The patient was referred for evaluation of cataracts bilaterally.,On examination, the patient was seeing 20/40 in her right eye and 20/50 in the left eye.  Extraocular muscles were intact, visual fields were full to confrontation OU, and applanations are 12 mmHg bilaterally.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect.  On slit lamp examination, lids and lashes were within normal limits.  The conj is quiet.  The cornea shows 1+ guttata bilaterally.  The AC is deep and quiet and irises are within normal limits bilaterally.  There is a dense 3 to 4+ nuclear sclerotic cataract in each eye.  On dilated fundus examination, cup-to-disc ratio is 0.1 OU.  The vitreous, macula, vessels, and periphery all appear within normal limits.,Impression:  It appears that Ms. ABC' visual decline is caused by bilateral cataracts.  She would benefit from having removed.  The patient also showed some mild guttata OU indicating possible early Fuchs dystrophy.  The patient should do well with cataract surgery and I have recommended this and she agreed to proceed with the first eye here shortly.

The patient was brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  A lid speculum was placed.  The posterior segment infusion was placed by the vitreoretinal service.  Peritomy was performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  A large Flieringa ring was then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk sutures tied in an interrupted fashion.  The cornea was then measured and was found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  The center of the cornea was marked.  The keratoprosthesis was identified.,A 7.5-mm trephine blade was then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  This was done after a paracentesis was placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic was used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  Once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea was performed.  Corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  The keratoprosthesis was placed in position and was sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point, the case was turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  At the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient was brought under the care of the cornea service.  The 9-0 Prolene sutures double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  The keratoprosthesis was removed.  Prior to this removal, scleral flaps were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions underneath the peritomies.  Wet-field cautery also was performed to achieve hemostasis.  The leading hepatic sutures were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  These were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  The trailing hepatic was then placed into the posterior segment of the eye as well.  The trailing haptic sutures were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  These were tied securely into position with the IOL nicely centered.  At this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm was then brought into the field.  This was secured with four cardinal sutures.  The corneal button was then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  The knot was secured and buried after adequate tension was adjusted.  The corneal graft was watertight.  Attention was then turned back to the IOL sutures, which were locked into position.  The ends were trimmed.  The flaps were secured with single 10-0 nylon sutures to the apex, and the knots were buried.  At this point, the case was then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  The patient tolerated the corneal portions of the surgery well and was turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  No complications were noted.  The attending surgeon, Dr. X, performed the entire procedure.  No complications of the procedure were noted.  The intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations.  No qualified resident was available to assist.","ophthalmology, vitrectomy, endolaser, keratoplasty, intraocular lens implant, preretinal hemorrhage, scleral flaps, intraocular, keratoprosthesis, chamber, implant, scleral, vitreoretinal, lens, sutures, eye, "

After anesthesia was induced in the operating room, tetracaine drops were applied to each eye and the pressure of the eyes were checked with Tono-Pen.  The pressure on the right was 17 mmHg and on the left was 16 mmHg.,A punctal dilator was then used to dilate the left superior puncta.  A size 00 Bowman probe was used to navigate the superior puncta and canaliculus with traction of the eyelid temporally.  The probe was advanced until a firm stop of the lacrimal bone was felt.  The probe was rotated in a superior and medial fashion along the brow to allow for navigation through the nasolacrimal sac and duct.  A mild resistance was felt at the distal aspect of the nasolacrimal duct consistent with a location of the valve.  There was also some mild stenosis distally, but not felt significant.  The probe was used to navigate through this mild resistance.  A second Bowman probe was then placed through the left naris and metal on metal contact was felt confirming patency.  Both probes were removed.  The 00 Bowman probe was then used to navigate the inferior puncta canaliculus system.  Patency was confirmed.  The left upper lid was everted and inspected and was found to be normal.,Attention was then turned to the right side where the similar procedure through the right superior puncta was performed.  A punctal dilator was used to dilate the puncta followed by a size 00 Bowman probe.  Again on this side, a size 0 Bowman probe was unable to be placed initially to the superior puncta.  The probe was used to navigate the superior puncta, canaliculus, and then the probe was rotated superomedially and the probe was advanced.  Similar amount of distal stenosis and distal nasolacrimal duct obstruction was felt.  The mild resistance was over come at the approximate location of the valve.  Metal-on-metal feel confirmed patency through the right naris with a second metal probe.  At the completion of the procedure all probes were removed.  Awakened and taken to the postanesthesia recovery unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Postoperative instructions were provided to the parents by me, and the discharging nurse.  I did advised nasolacrimal massage for the next 7 to 10 days on each side two to three times daily.  Technique explained and demonstrated.  Erythromycin ointment to both eyes twice daily for three days.

The next day he woke up and he had double vision again. ", Ophthalmology, Diplopia ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 53-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents to the clinic for further evaluation of diplopia.  He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009.  He had double vision.  He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated.  The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour.  He was able to drive.  However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again.  Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe.  He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation.  He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation.  He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm.  The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia.  Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together.  He still does not drive.  He also is not working due to the double vision.  There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision.  More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain.  It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid.  He denies any dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological symptoms.,There is a neurology consultation in the computer system.  Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department.  He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side.  MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative.  He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal.  His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.,At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis.  He had left gaze diplopia.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal.  According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil.  There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities.  I do not have the official ophthalmologic consultation available to me today.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient denies any previous past medical history.  He currently does not have a primary care physician as he is uninsured.,MEDICATIONS:,  He does not take any medications.,ALLERGIES: , He has no known drug allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with his wife.  He was an IT software developer, but he has been out of work for several months.  He smokes less than a pack of cigarettes daily.  He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.,FAMILY HISTORY: , His mother died of a stroke in her 90s.  His father had colon cancer.  He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.

Simultaneous recordings were made in both eyes in the horizontal direction and the left eye in the vertical directions.  Caloric irrigations were performed using a closed loop irrigation system at 30 degrees and 44 degrees C into either ear.,FINDINGS: , Gaze testing did not reveal any evidence of nystagmus.  Saccadic movements did not reveal any evidence of dysmetria or overshoot.  Sinusoidal tracking was performed well for the patient's age.  Optokinetic nystagmus testing was performed poorly due to the patient's difficulty in following the commands.  Therefore adequate OKNs were not achieved.  The Dix-Hallpike maneuver in the head handing left position resulted in moderate intensity left beating nystagmus, which was converted to a right beating nystagmus when she sat up again.  The patient complained of severe dizziness in this position.  There was no clear-cut decremental response with repetition.  In the head hanging left position, no significant nystagmus was identified.  Positional testing in the supine, head hanging, head right, head left, right lateral decubitus, and left lateral decubitus positions did not reveal any evidence of nystagmus.,Caloric stimulation revealed a calculated unilateral weakness of 7.0% on the right (normal <20%) and left beating directional preponderance of 6.0% (normal <20-30%).,IMPRESSION: , Abnormal electronystagmogram demonstrating prominent nystagmus on position testing in the head hanging right position.  No other significant nystagmus was noted.  There was no evidence of clear-cut caloric stimulation abnormality.  This study would be most consistent with a right vestibular dysfunction.","ophthalmology, silver chloride biopotential electrodes, inferior orbital margins, lateral canthi, vestibular dysfunction, prominent nystagmus, head hanging, electronystagmogram, eyes, nystagmus,"

Transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty with removal of a portion of the medial and middle fat pad.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , The patient is a 28-year-old country and western performer who was involved in a motor vehicle accident over a year ago.  Since that time, she is felt to have facial asymmetry, which is apparent in publicity photographs for her record promotions.  She had requested a procedure to bring about further facial asymmetry.  She was seen preoperatively by psychiatrist specializing in body dysmorphic disorder as well as analysis of the patient's requesting cosmetic surgery and was felt to be a psychiatrically good candidate.  She did have facial asymmetry with the bit of more fullness in higher cheekbone on the right as compared to the left.  Preoperative workup including CT scan failed to show any skeletal trauma.  The patient was counseled with regard to the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the postsurgical procedure including but not limited to bleeding, infection, unacceptable cosmetic appearance, numbness of the face, change in sensation of the face, facial nerve paralysis, need for further surgery, need for revision, hair loss, etc., and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position after having been marked in the upright position while awake.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced with a #6 endotracheal tube.  All appropriate measures were taken to preserve the vocal cords in a professional singer.  Local anesthesia consisting of 5/6th 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine in 1/6th 0.25% Marcaine was mixed and then injected in a regional field block fashion in the subperiosteal plane via the gingivobuccal sulcus injection on either side as well as into the temporal fossa at the level of the true temporal fascia.  The upper eyelids were injected with 1 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine.  Adequate time for vasoconstriction and anesthesia was allowed to be obtained.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture was placed in the right lower lid.  For traction, it was brought anteriorly.  The conjunctiva was incised with the needle tip Bovie with Jaeger lid plate protecting the cornea and globe.  A Q-Tip was then used to separate the orbicularis oculi muscle from the fat pad beneath and carried down to the bone.  The middle and medial fat pads were identified and a small amount of fat was removed from each to take care of the pseudofat herniation, which was present.  The inferior oblique muscle was identified, preserved, and protected throughout the procedure.  The transconjunctival incision was then closed with buried knots of 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results and throughout the procedure.  Lacri-Lube was in the eyes in order to maintain hydration.  Attention was next turned to the midface, where a temporal incision was made parallel to the nasojugal folds.  Dissection was carried out with the hemostat down to the true temporal fascia and the endoscopic temporal dissection dissector was used to elevate the true temporal fascia.  A 30-degree endoscope was used to visualize the fat pads, so that we knew we are in the proper plane.  Subperiosteal dissection was carried out over the zygomatic arch and Whitnall's tubercle and the temporal dissection was completed.,Next, bilateral gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were made and a Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum of the midface and anterior face of the maxilla from the tendon of the masseter muscle up to Whitnall's tubercle.  The two dissection planes within joint in the subperiosteal fashion and dissection proceeded laterally out to the zygomatic neurovascular bundle.  It was bipolar electrocauteried and the tunnel was further dissected free and opened.  The endotine 4.5 soft tissue suspension device was then inserted through the temporal incision, brought down into the subperiosteal midface plane of dissection.  The guard was removed and the suspension spikes were engaged into the soft tissues.  The spikes were elevated superiorly such that a symmetrical midface elevation was carried out bilaterally.  The endotine device was then secured to the true temporal fascia with three sutures of 3-0 PDS suture.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results in order to achieve facial symmetry and symmetry was obtained.  The gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were closed with interrupted 4-0 chromic and the scalp incision was closed with staples.  The sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.","ophthalmology, cosmetic surgery, jaeger lid plate, lacri-lube, q-tip, blepharoplasty, conjunctiva, facial asymmetry, fat pad, lower lid, midface lift, regional field block, temporal fascia, temporal fossa, vasoconstriction, true temporal fascia, gingivobuccal sulcus, gingivobuccal,"
2428, Clear corneal temporal incision (no stitches).  A lid speculum was placed in the fissure of the right eye., Ophthalmology, Clear Corneal Temporal Incision ,"CLEAR CORNEAL TEMPORAL INCISION (NO STITCHES),DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , Under satisfactory local anesthesia, the patient was appropriately prepped and draped.  A lid speculum was placed in the fissure of the right eye.,The secondary incision was then made through clear cornea using 1-mm diamond keratome at surgeon's 7:30 position and the anterior chamber re-formed using viscoelastic.  The primary incision was then made using a 3-mm diamond keratome at the surgeon's 5 o'clock position and additional viscoelastic injected into the anterior chamber as needed.  The capsulorrhexis was then performed in a standard circular tear fashion.  The nucleus was then separated from its cortical attachments by hydrodissection and emulsified in the capsular bag.  The residual cortex was then aspirated from the bag and the bag re-expanded using viscoelastic.  The posterior chamber intraocular lens was then inspected, irrigated, coated with Healon and folded, and then placed into the capsular bag under direct visualization.  The lens was noted to center well.  The residual viscoelastic was then removed from the eye and the eye re-formed using balanced salt solution.  The eye was then checked and found to be watertight; therefore, no suture was used.  The lid speculum and the drapes were then removed and the eye treated with Maxitrol ointment.,A shield was applied and the patient returned to the recovery room in good condition.","ophthalmology, clear corneal temporal incision, intraocular lens, corneal temporal incision, lid speculum, incision, temporal, chamber, corneal, viscoelastic, eyeNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

She also has a history of glaucoma diagnosed in 1990 and macular degeneration.  She has been followed in her home country and is here visiting family.  She had the above-mentioned observation and was brought in on an urgent basis today.,Her past medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism.,Her medications include V-optic 0.5% eye drops to both eyes twice a day and pilocarpine 2% OU three times a day.  She took both the drops this morning.  She also takes Eltroxin which is for hypothyroidism, Plendil for blood pressure, and pravastatin.,She is allergic to Cosopt.,She has a family history of blindness in her brother as well as glaucoma and hypertension.,Her visual acuity today at distance without correction are 20/25 in the right and count fingers at 3 feet in the left eye.  Manifest refraction showed no improvement in either eye.  The intraocular pressures by applanation were 7 on the right and 18 in the left eye.  Gonioscopy showed grade 4 open angles in both eyes.  Humphrey visual field testing done elsewhere showed diffuse reduction in sensitivity in both eyes.  The lids were normal OU.  She has mild dry eye OU.  The corneas are clear OU.  The anterior chamber is deep and quiet OU.  Irides appear normal.  The lenses show well centered posterior chamber intraocular lenses OU.,Dilated fundus exam shows clear vitreous OU.  The optic nerves are normal in size.  They both appear to have mild pallor.  The optic cups in both eyes are shallow.  The cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye is not overtly large, would estimated 0.5 to 0.6; however, she does have very thin rim tissue inferotemporally in the right eye.  In the left eye, the glaucoma appears to be more advanced to the larger cup-to-disc ratio and a thinner rim tissue.,The macula on the right shows drusen with focal areas of RPE atrophy.  I do not see any evidence of neovascularization such as subretinal fluid, lipid or hemorrhage.  She does have a punctate area of RPE atrophy which is just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  In the left eye, she has also several high-risk drusen, but no evidence of neovascularization.  The RPE in the left eye does appear to be more diffusely abnormal although these changes do appear somewhat mild.  I do not see any dense or focal areas of frank RPE atrophy or hypertrophy.,The peripheral retinas are attached in both eyes.,Ms. ABC has pseudophakia OU which is stable and she is doing well in this regard.  She has glaucoma which likely is worse in the left eye and also likely explains her poor vision in the left eye.  The intraocular pressure in the mid-to-high teens in the left eye is probably high for her.  She has allergic reaction to Cosopt.  I will recommend starting Xalatan OS nightly.  I think the intraocular pressure in the right eye is acceptable and is probably a stable pressure for her OD.  She will need followup in the next 1 or 2 months after returning home to Israel later this week after starting the new medication which is Xalatan.,Regarding the macular degeneration, she has had high-risk changes in both eyes.  The vision in the right eye is good, but she does have a very concerning area of RPE atrophy just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  I strongly recommend that she see a retina specialist before returning to Israel in order to fully discuss prophylactic measures to prevent worsening of her macular degeneration in the right eye.","ophthalmology, cataract extraction, lens implants, decreased vision, macular degeneration, intraocular pressures, rpe atrophy, eye, degeneration, glaucoma, macular, vision, "

He was anesthetized with a combination of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine with Epinephrine on both upper eyelids.  The area of obvious scar tissue from the radiation for the squamous cell carcinoma on the right upper eyelid was completely excised down to the eyelid margin including resection of a few of the upper eye lashes.  This was extended essentially from the punctum to the lateral commissure and extended up on to the upper eyelid.  The resection was carried down through the orbicularis muscle resecting the pretarsal orbicularis muscle and the inferior portion of the preseptal orbicularis muscle leaving the tarsus intact and leaving the orbital septum intact.  Following complete resection, the patient was easily able to open and close his eyes as the levator muscle insertion was left intact to the tarsal plate.  The specimen was sent to pathology, which revealed only fibrotic tissue and no evidence of any residual squamous cell carcinoma.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with Bovie cautery and a full-thickness skin graft was taken from the opposite upper eyelid in a fashion similar to a blepharoplasty of the appropriate size for the defect in the right upper eyelid.  The left upper eyelid incision was closed with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures, and the skin graft was sutured in place with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures.  An eye patch was placed on the right side, and the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to PACU in good condition.","ophthalmology, frozen section, full-thickness skin grafting, squamous cell carcinoma, eyelid, orbicularis,"

Hemodynamic monitoring was begun.  Time-out was called and the patient eye operated upon and lens implant intended were verbally verified.  Three drops of tetracaine were applied to the operative eye.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for intraocular surgery.  A lid speculum was placed.  Two paracentesis sites were created approximately 120 degrees apart straddling the temple using a slit knife.  The anterior chamber was irrigated with a dilute 0.25% solution of non-preserved lidocaine and filled with Viscoat.  The clear corneal temporal incision was fashioned.  The anterior chamber was entered by introducing a keratome.  The continuous tear capsulorrhexis was performed using the bent needle cystotome and completed with Utrata forceps.  The cataractous lens was then hydrodissected and phacoemulsified using a modified phaco-chop technique.  Following removal of the last nuclear quadrant, there was noted to be a posterior capsular hole nasally.  This area was tamponaded with Healon.  The anterior chamber was swept with a cyclodialysis spatula and there was noted to be vitreous prolapse.  An anterior vitrectomy was then performed bimanually until the vitreous was cleared from the anterior chamber area.  The sulcus area of the lens was then inflated using Healon and a V9002 16.0 diopter intraocular lens was unfolded and centered in the sulcus area with haptic secured in the sulcus.  There was noted to be good support.  Miostat was injected into the anterior chamber and viscoelastic agent rinsed out of the eye with Miostat.  Gentle bimanual irrigation, aspiration was performed to remove remaining viscoelastic agents anteriorly.  The pupil was noted to constrict symmetrically.  Wounds were checked with Weck-cels and found to be free of vitreous.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to normal depth as confirmed by tactile pressure at about 12.  All corneal wounds were then hydrated, checked and found to be watertight and free of vitreous.  A single 10-0 nylon suture was placed temporarily as prophylaxis and the knot buried.  Lid speculum was removed.  TobraDex ointment, light patch and a Soft Shield were applied.  The patient was taken to the recovery room, awake and comfortable.  We will follow up in the morning for postoperative check.  He will not be given Diamox due to his sulfa allergy.  The intraoperative course was discussed with both he and his wife.","ophthalmology, intraocular lens implant, lid speculum, cataract extraction, anterior vitrectomy, anterior chamber, eye, intraocular, extraction, hemodynamic, implant, vitrectomy, vitreous, cataract, lens,"

2437, A sample note on Cataract, Ophthalmology, Cataract ,"CATARACT, is the loss of transparency of the lens of the eye.  It often appears like a window that is fogged with steam.,WHAT CAUSES CATARACT FORMATION?,*  Aging, the most common cause.,*  Family history.,*  Steroid use.,*  Injury to the eye.,*  Diabetes.,*  Previous eye surgery.,*  Long-term exposure to sunlight.,HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE A CATARACT?,*  The best way for early detection is regular eye examinations by your medical eye doctor. There are many causes of visual loss in addition to the cataract such as problems involving the optic nerve and retina.  If these other problems exist, cataract removal may not result in the return or improvement of vision.  Your eye doctor can tell you how much improvement in vision is likely.,DOES IT TAKE A LONG TIME FOR A CATARACT TO FORM?,Cataract development varies greatly between patients and is affected by the cause of the cataract.  Generally, cataracts progress gradually over many years.  Some people, especially diabetics and younger patients, may find that cataract formation progresses rapidly over a few months making it impossible to know exactly how long it will take for the cataract to develop. ,WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR CATARACTS?,The only way to remove a cataract is surgery.  If the symptoms are not restricting your activity, a change of glasses may alleviate the symptoms at this time.  No medications, exercise, optical devices or dietary supplements have been shown to stop the progression or prevent cataracts.,It is important to provide protection from excessive sunlight.  Making sure that the sunglasses you wear screen out ultraviolet (UV) light rays or your regular eyeglasses are coated with a clear, anti-UV coating will help prevent or slow the progression of cataracts.,HOW DO I KNOW IF I NEED SURGERY?,Surgery is considered when your vision is interfering with your daily activities.  It is important to evaluate if you can see to do your job and drive safely.  Can you read and watch TV in comfort? Are you able to cook, do your shopping and yard work or take your medications without difficulty? Depending on how you feel your vision is affecting your daily life, you and your eye doctor will decide together when it is the appropriate time to do surgery.,WHAT IS INVOLVED WITH CATARACT SURGERY?,This surgery is generally performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis.  With the assistance of a microscope, the cloudy lens is removed and replaced with a permanent intraocular lens implant.,Right after the surgery you should be able to immediately perform all your normal activities except for the most strenuous ones.  You will need to take eye drops as directed by your eye doctor.  Follow-up visits are necessary to make sure the surgical site is healing without problems.,This procedure is performed on over 1.4 million people each year in the United States alone, 95% without complications.  With this highly successful procedure, 90% of the time vision improves unless a problem also exists with the cornea, retina or optic nerve.  As with any surgery, a good result cannot be guaranteed.","ophthalmology, transparency, eye, sunlight, optic nerve, eye doctor, cataract, retina, lens, vision, surgery, "

Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  Sequential compression devices were also placed.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas.  Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  There was no obvious urine extravasation.  At this time, the procedure was terminated.  The robot was undocked.  Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.","nephrology, pyeloplasty, ureteral stent placement, nephrolithotomy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, jackson-pratt drain, foley catheter, renal pelvis, kidney stones, monocryl sutures, pelvis, renal, ureteropelvic, sutures, "
2983," Acute renal failure, suspected, likely due to multi-organ system failure syndrome.", Nephrology, Renal Failure - Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Acute renal failure.,HISTORY: , Limited data is available; I have reviewed his admission notes. Apparently this man was found down by a family member, was taken to Medical Center, and subsequently flown here. He has got respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure syndrome, and has renal insufficiency, as well. Markers of renal function have been fairly stable. I do not presently see indicators that he historically has been oliguric. The BUN and creatinine have been fairly stable. It is not clear whether he was taking his lisinopril up until the time of his demise, and it is also not clear whether he was taking his diuretic. Earlier thoughts had been that he could have had rhabdomyolysis, but the highest CPK I find recorded is 1500, the phosphorus is not elevated, though I acknowledge the serum calcium is low. I see no markers of myoglobinuria nor serum level of myoglobin. He has received IV fluid resuscitation, good broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, continues mechanically ventilated, and is on parenteral nutrition.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Not obtained from the patient, but is reviewed in other physician's notes and seems notable for probably atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease wherein he was taking Imdur and digoxin, reportedly. A suggestion of hypertensive disease versus BPH, he was on terazosin. Suggestion of CHF versus hypertension versus volume overload, treated with Lasix. He was iron, I presume for anemia. He was on potassium, lisinopril and aspirin.,ALLERGIES:, OTHER PHYSICIAN'S NOTES INDICATE NO KNOWN ALLERGIES.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Not available.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, Not available.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Not available.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: An older white male who is intubated, edematous, and appears uncomfortable.,HEENT: Male pattern baldness. Pupils equally round, no icterus. Intubated. OG tube in place.,NECK: Not tested for suppleness, no carotid bruits are heard. Neck vein distention is not seen.,LUNGS: He has diffuse expiratory wheezing anteriorly, laterally and posteriorly. I would describe the wheezes as coarse. I hear no present rales. Breath sounds otherwise are symmetrical.,HEART: Heart tones regular to auscultation, currently without audible rub or gallop sounds.,BREASTS: Not enlarged.,ABDOMEN: On plane. Bowel sounds presently are normal. Abdomen, I believe, is soft on plane, normal bowel sounds, no bruits, no liver edge felt, no HJR, no spleen tip, no suprapubic fullness.,GU: Catheter draining a dark yellow urine.,EXTREMITIES: Very edematous. Pulses not palpable. Cyanosis not observed. Fungal changes are not observed.,NEUROLOGICAL: Not otherwise assessed.,LABORATORY DATA:, Reviewed.,IMPRESSION:,1. Acute renal failure, suspected. Likely due to multi-organ system failure syndrome, with antecedent lisinopril use at home and at time of demise. He also reportedly was on Lasix prior to hospitalization, ? hypovolemia as a consequence.,2. Multi-organ system failure/systemic inflammatory response syndrome, with septic shock.,3. I am under-whelmed presently with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, if the maximum CK recorded is 1500.,4. Antecedent hypoxemia, with renal hypoperfusion.,5. Diffuse aspiration pneumonitis suggested.,DISCUSSION/PLAN: ,I think the renal function will follow the patient. Supportive care, attention to stability of a euvolemic state, will be important at this time. He is currently nonoliguric, has apparently stable, diffuse, bilateral wheezing, with adequate gas exchange. He is on TPN, antimicrobials, and has been on vasopressive agents. Blood pressures are close to acceptable, he may now be wearing off his lisinopril, assuming he was taking it prior to admission.,I would use diuretics to maintain central euvolemia. Recorded I's are substantially O's during the course of the hospitalization, I presume as part of his resuscitation effort. No central pressures or monitoring of same is currently available. I will follow with you. No present indication for hemodialysis. Antimicrobials are being handled by others.",
2984, Cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis - endstage renal disease., Nephrology, Renal Transplant - Cadaveric ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 50-year-old African American female with past medical history significant for hypertension and endstage renal disease, on hemodialysis secondary to endstage renal disease, last hemodialysis was on June 22, 2007.  The patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant.  After appropriate cross match and workup of HLA typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Endstage renal disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Endstage renal disease.,PROCEDURE:,  Cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 400 mL.,FLUIDS:  ,One liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,SPECIMEN:  ,None.,DRAIN: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient tolerated the procedure without any complication.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  After adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space.  After this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  Camper's and Scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  Additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  After these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  Upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  After the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  After the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  The right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  This was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  At this time, Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  This was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  A 5-0 double-ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 Prolene, these were tied down and secured.  The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  After such time the 5-0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  After this was done and the artery was secured, the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  At this time, all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  Before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  At this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  Subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  This was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  At this time, an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  This was inspected and noted for proper control.  Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  At this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  A 1-0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  This was secured and knots were dumped.  Subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running Monocryl.  The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable.

He also felt like he could not make much urine, and his wife, who is a nurse instructed him to force fluids.  While he was there, he was drinking cranberry juice, some Powerade, but he also has a history of weightlifting and had been taking on a creatine protein drink on a daily basis for some time now.  He presented here with very decreased urine output until a Foley catheter was placed and about 500 mL was noted in his bladder.  He did have a CPK level of about 234 while his BUN and creatinine on admission were 109 and 6.9.  Despite IV hydration fluids, his potassium has gone up from 5.4 to 6.1.  He did not put out any significant urine and his weight was documented at 103 kg.  He was given a dose of Kayexalate.  His potassium came down to like about 5.9 and urine studies were ordered.  His urinalysis did show that he had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and his protein-creatinine ratio was about 9 gm of protein consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria.  He did have a low albumin of 1.9.  He denied any nonsteroidal usage, any recreational drug abuse, and his urine drug screen was unremarkable, and he denied any history of hypertension or any other medical problems.  He has not had any blood work except for drug screens that are required by work and no work up by any primary care physician because he has not seen one for primary care.  He is very concerned because his mother and father were both on dialysis, which he thinks were due to diabetes and both parents have expired.  He denied any hemoptysis, gross hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hemoptysis, hematemesis, no seizures, no palpitations, no pruritus, no chest pain.  He did have a decrease in his appetite, which all started about Thursday.

She had had a previous PD catheter placed, but it became infected and had to be removed.  She, therefore, comes back to the operating room for a new PD catheter.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A small transverse right upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The fascia was divided and the posterior fascia and peritoneum were identified.  A hole was made in the posterior fascia through the peritoneum and into the peritoneal cavity.  The omentum came up through the hole and so therefore the omentum was actually brought up and a small portion of it removed, which could easily be brought up through the incision.  A PD catheter was then placed into the pelvis over a guidewire.  At this point, the peritoneum and posterior fascia was closed around the catheter.  The anterior fascia was then closed over the top of the cuff leaving the cuff buried in the fascia.  The second incision was then made lateral and the catheter brought out through a second incision and the subcutaneous cuff then positioned at that site.  The catheter was then connected and two runs of a 150 mL of fluid were made with a good inflow and a good clear return.  The skin was closed with 5-0 subcuticular Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied and the young lady awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","nephrology, pd catheter, catheter, omentum, peritoneal dialysis catheter, peritoneal dialysis, renal failure, peritoneal, dialysis, renal"

The patient was recently thought to have obstruction to the transplant and a stent was placed in to the transplant percutaneously, but the ureter was wide open and there was no evidence of obstruction.  Because the kidney was felt to be irretrievably lost and immunosuppression had been withdrawn, it was elected to go ahead and remove the kidney and hopes that her fever and toxic course could be arrested.,With the patient in the supine position, the previously placed nephrostomy tube was removed.  The patient then after adequate prepping and draping, and placing of a small roll under the right hip, underwent an incision in the direction of the transplant incision down through and through all muscle layers and into the preperitoneal space.  The kidney was encountered and kidney was dissected free of its attachments through the retroperitoneal space.  During the course of dissection, the iliac artery and vein were identified as was the native ureter and the patient's ilioinguinal nerve; all these were preserved.  The individual vessels in the kidney were identified, ligated, and incised, and the kidney was removed.  The ureter was encountered during the course of resection, but was not ligated.

Acute renal failure, which in all probability is secondary to acute tubular necrosis and sepsis and significant hypotension, but the patient is at the moment on 100% FiO2.  He has been given intravenous fluid at a high rate to replete intravascular volume and to hopefully address his acidosis.  The patient also has significant acidosis and his creatinine has increased from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight.  Given the fact that he would need dialytic support for his electrolyte derangements and for volume control, I would suggest continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration as opposed to conventional hemodialysis as the patient will not be able to tolerate conventional hemodialysis given his hemodynamic instability.,2.  Hypotension, which is significant and is related to his sepsis.  Now the patient has been maintained on Levophed and high rate of intravenous fluid at the moment.,3.

2998," Septic from nephrolithiasis - Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy and stent placed in the left ureter, urinary incontinence, recent sepsis.", Nephrology, Nephrolithiasis - Progress Note ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.

This is an enhancing lesion suspicious for renal cell carcinoma versus oncocytoma.  I discussed a variety of options with her, and she opted to proceed with a laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy.  All questions were answered, and she wished to proceed with surgery as planned.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After acquisition of appropriate written and informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  Note that, sequential compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and were activated per induction of anesthesia.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via the endotracheal route, she was placed into the right anterior flank position with the right side elevated in a roll and the right arm across her chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and she was securely taped to the table to prevent shifting during the procedure.  Her abdomen was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion after placing a 16-French Foley catheter per urethra to gravity drainage.  The abdomen was insufflated in the right outer quadrant.  Note that, the patient had had previous surgery which complicated accesses somewhat and that she had a previous hysterectomy.  The abdomen was insufflated into the right lateral abdomen with Veress needle to 50 mm of pressure without incident.  We then placed a 10/12 Visiport trocar approximately 7 cm lateral to the umbilicus.  Once this had entered into the peritoneal cavity without incident, the remaining trocars were all placed.  Under direct laparoscopic visualization, we placed three additional trocars; an 11-mm screw-type trocar in the umbilicus, a 6-mm screw-type trocar in the upper midline approximately 7 cm above the umbilicus, and 10/12 trocar in the lower midline about 7 cm below the umbilicus within and over the old hysterectomy scar.  There were some adhesions of omentum to the underside of that scar, and these were taken down sharply using laparoscopic scissors.,We began nephrectomy procedure by reflecting the right colon, by incising the white line of Toldt.  This exposed the retroperitoneum on the right side.  The duodenum was identified and reflected medially in a Kocher maneuver using sharp dissection only.  We then identified the ureter and gonadal vein in the retroperitoneum.  The gonadal vein was left down along the vena cava, and the plane underneath the ureter was elevated and this plane was carried up towards the renal hilum.  Sequential packets of tissue were taken using primarily the LigaSure Atlas device.  Once we got to the renal hilum, it became apparent that this patient had two sets of renal arteries and veins.  We proceeded then and skeletonized the structures into four individual packets.  We then proceeded to perform the upper pole dissection and developing the plane above the kidney and between the kidney and adrenal gland.  The adrenal was spared during this procedure.  There was no contiguous connection between the renal mass and a right adrenal gland.  This plane of dissection was taken down primarily using the LigaSure device.  We then sequentially took the four vessels going to the kidney initially taking two renal arteries with the endo GI stapler and then to renal veins again with endo GI stapler sequential flaring.  Once this was completed, the kidney was free except for its attachment to the ureter and lateral attachments.  The lateral attachments of the kidney were taken down using the LigaSure Atlas device, and then the ureter was doubly clipped and transected.  The kidney was then freed within the retroperitoneum.  A 50-mm EndoCatch bag was introduced through the lower most trocar site, and the kidney was placed into this bag for subsequent extraction.  We extended the lower most trocar site approximately 6 cm to facilitate extraction.  The kidney was removed and passed off the table as a specimen for pathology.  This was bivalved by pathology, and we reviewed the specimen.","nephrology, renal mass, carter-thomason, endocatch bag, foley catheter, gi stapler, laparoscopic, ligasure, toldt, laparoscopic scissors, nephrectomy, radical nephrectomy, screw-type trocar, umbilicus, upper pole, urethra, carter thomason closure device, laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy, carter thomason closure, carter thomason, renal hilum, kidney, abdomen, endotracheal, radical, oncocytoma, renal, "

An orogastric was placed and a Foley catheter placed.  He was placed in a modified flank position with the hips rotated to 45 degrees.  Pillow was used to prevent any pressure points.  He was widely shaved, prepped, and draped.  A marking pen was used to delineate a site for the Pneumo sleeve in the right lower quadrant and for the trocar sites in the midline just above the umbilicus and halfway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus.  The incision was made through the premarked site through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The aponeurosis of the external oblique was incised in the direction of its fibers.  Muscle-splitting incision was made in the internal oblique and transversus abdominis.  The peritoneum was opened and the Pneumo sleeve was placed in the usual fashion being sure that no bowel was trapped inside the ring.  Then, abdominal insufflation was carried out through the Pneumo sleeve and the scope was passed through the Pneumo sleeve to visualize placement of the trocars in the other two positions.  Once this had been completed, the scope was placed in the usual port and dissection begun by taking down the white line of Toldt, so that the colon could be retracted medially.  This exposed the duodenum, which was gently swept off the inferior vena cava and dissection easily disclosed the takeoff of the right renal vein off the cava.  Next, attention was directed inferiorly and the ureter was divided between clips and the inferior tongue of Gerota fascia was taken down, so that the psoas muscle was exposed.  The attachments lateral to the kidney was taken down, so that the kidney could be flipped anteriorly and medially, and this helped in exposing the renal artery.  The renal artery had been previously noticed on the CT scan to branch early and so each branch was separately ligated and divided using the stapler device.  After the arteries had been divided, the renal vein was divided again using a stapling device.  The remaining attachments superior to the kidney were divided with the Harmonic scalpel and also utilized the stapler, and the specimen was removed.  Reexamination of the renal fossa at low pressures showed a minimal degree of oozing from the adrenal gland, which was controlled with Surgicel.  Next, the port sites were closed with 0 Vicryl utilizing the passer and doing it over the hand to prevent injury to the bowel and the right lower quadrant incision for the hand port was closed in the usual fashion.  The estimated blood loss was negligible.  There were no complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in satisfactory condition.","nephrology, renal mass, foley catheter, gerota fascia, muscle-splitting incision, pneumo sleeve, endotracheal, laparoscopic, nephrectomy, orogastric, renal fossa, right lower quadrant, trocar, umbilicus, vena cava, renal, pneumo, radical, "

I had a long discussion with him concerning variety of options.  We talked in particular about extirpated versus ablative surgery.  Based on his young age and excellent state of health, decision was made at this point to proceed to a right partial nephrectomy laparoscopically.  All questions were answered, and he wished to proceed with surgery as planned.  Note that the patient does have a positive family history of renal cell carcinoma.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After acquisition of proper informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via endotracheal rod, he was placed into the right anterior flank position with his right side elevated on a roll and his right arm across his chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and he was securely taped to the table.  Note that sequential compression devices were in place on both lower extremities and were activated prior to induction of anesthesia.  His abdomen was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Note that a #16-French Foley catheter was in place per urethra as well as an orogastric tube.  The abdomen was insufflated at the right lateral abdomen using the Veress needle to a pressure of 15 without incident.  We then placed a Visiport 10 x 12 trocar in the right lateral abdomen.  With the trocar in place, we were able to place the remaining trocars under direct laparoscopic visualization.  We placed three additional trocars.  An 11 mm screw type trocar at the umbilicus, a 6 screw type trocar 7 cm in the midline above the umbilicus, and a 10 x 12 trocar to serve as a retractor port approximately 8 cm inferior in the midline.,The procedure was begun by reflecting the right colon by incising the white line of Toldt.  The colon was reflected medially, and the retroperitoneum was exposed on that side.  This was a fairly superficial lesion, so decision was made in advance to potentially not perform vascular clamping, however, I did feel it important to get high level control prior to proceeding to the partial.  With the colon reflected, the duodenum was identified, and it was reflected medially under Kocher maneuver.  The ureter and gonadal vein were identified on the right side and elevated.  The space between the ureter and the gonadal vein was then developed, and the gonadal vein was dropped elevating only the ureter, and carrying this plane dissection up towards the renal hilum.  Once we got up to the renal hilum, we were able to skeletonize the renal hilar vessels partially, and in particular, we did develop some of the upper pole dissection above the level of the hilum to provide for access for a Satinsky clamp or bulldogs.  The remainder of the kidney was then freed off its lateral and superior attachments primarily using the Harmonic scalpel and the LigaSure device.,With the kidney free and the hilum prepared, the Gerota fascia was taken down overlying the kidney exposing the renal parenchyma, and using this approach, we were able to identify the 2-cm, right renal mass located in the lower pole laterally.  A cap of fat was left overlying this mass.  Based on the position of the mass, we performed intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound, which showed the mass to be somewhat deeper than initially anticipated.  Based on this finding, I decided to go ahead and clamp the renal hilum during resection.  A Satinsky clamp was introduced through the lower most trocar site and used to clamp the renal hilum en bloc.  Note that the patient had been receiving renal protection protocol including fenoldopam and mannitol throughout the procedure, and he also received Lasix prior to clamping the renal hilum.  With the renal hilum clamped, we did resect the tumor using cold scissors.  There was somewhat more bleeding than would be expected based on the hilar clamping; however, we were able to successfully resect this lesion.  We also took a biopsy at the base of the resection and passed off the table as a specimen for frozen section.  With the tumor resected, the base of the resection was then cauterized using the Argon beam coagulator, and several bleeding vessels were oversewn using figure-of-eight 3-0 Vicryl sutures with lap ties for tensioning.  We then placed a FloSeal into the wound and covered it with a Surgicel and held the pressure.  We then released the vascular clamp.  Total clamp time was 11 minutes.  There was minimal bleeding and occlusion of this maneuver, and after unclamping the kidney, the kidney pinked up appropriately and appeared well perfused after removal of the clamp.  We then replaced the kidney within its Gerota envelope and closed that with 3-0 Vicryl using lap ties for tensioning.  A JP drain was introduced through the right flank and placed adjacent to the kidney and sutured the skin with 2-0 nylon.  The specimen was placed into a 10-mm Endocatch bag and extracted from the lower most trocar site after extending it approximately 1 cm.  It was evaluated on the table and passed off the table for Pathology to evaluate.  They stated that the tumor was close to the margin, but there appeared to be 1-2 mm normal parenchyma around the tumor.  In addition, the frozen section biopsies from the base of the resection were negative for renal cell carcinoma.  Based on these findings, the lower most trocar site was closed using a running 0 Vicryl suture in the fascia.  We then re-insufflated the abdomen and carefully evaluated the entire intraoperative field for hemostasis.  Any bleeding points were controlled primarily using bipolar cautery or hemoclips.  The area was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The colon was then replaced into its normal anatomic position.  The mesentry was evaluated.  There were no defects noted.  We closed the 10 x 12 lateral most trocar site using a Carter-Thompson closure device with 0-Vicryl.  All trocars were removed under direct visualization, and the abdomen was desufflated prior to removal of the last trocar.  The skin incisions were irrigated with normal saline and infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, and the skin was closed using a running 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Benzoin and Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient was returned in supine position and awoken from general anesthetic without incident.  He was then transferred to hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit for postoperative monitoring.  At the end of the case, sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct.  I was scrubbed and present throughout the entire case.","nephrology, renal mass, foley catheter, gerota fascia, jp drain, kocher maneuver, laparoscopic, ligasure device, satinsky clamp, toldt, bulldogs, nephrectomy, renal parenchyma, resection, urethra, vicryl sutures, partial nephrectomy, gonadal vein, renal hilum, satinsky, renal, kidney, hilum, foley, endotracheal, "

Due to the peripheral nature of the tumor located in the mid to lower pole laterally, he has elected to undergo a partial nephrectomy.  Potential complications include but are not limited to,,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Postoperative pain.,4.  Herniation from the incision.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  Epidural anesthesia was administered in the holding area, after which the patient was transferred into the operating room.  General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, after which the patient was positioned in the flank standard position.  A left flank incision was made over the area of the twelfth rib.  The subcutaneous space was opened by using the Bovie.  The ribs were palpated clearly and the fascia overlying the intercostal space between the eleventh and twelfth rib was opened by using the Bovie.  The fascial layer covering of the intercostal space was opened completely until the retroperitoneum was entered.  Once the retroperitoneum had been entered, the incision was extended until the peritoneal envelope could be identified.  The peritoneum was swept medially.  The Finochietto retractor was then placed for exposure.  The kidney was readily identified and was mobilized from outside Gerota's fascia.  The ureter was dissected out easily and was separated with a vessel loop.  The superior aspect of the kidney was mobilized from the superior attachment.  The pedicle of the left kidney was completely dissected revealing the vein and the artery.  The artery was a single artery and was dissected easily by using a right-angle clamp.  A vessel loop was placed around the renal artery.  The tumor could be easily palpated in the lateral lower pole to mid pole of the left kidney.  The Gerota's fascia overlying that portion of the kidney was opened in the area circumferential to the tumor.  Once the renal capsule had been identified, the capsule was scored using a Bovie about 0.5 cm lateral to the border of the tumor.  Bulldog clamp was then placed on the renal artery.  The tumor was then bluntly dissected off of the kidney with a thin rim of a normal renal cortex.  This was performed by using the blunted end of the scalpel.  The tumor was removed easily.  The argon beam coagulation device was then utilized to coagulate the base of the resection.  The visible larger bleeding vessels were oversewn by using 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The edges of the kidney were then reapproximated by using 2-0 Vicryl suture with pledgets at the ends of the sutures to prevent the sutures from pulling through.  Two horizontal mattress sutures were placed and were tied down.  The Gerota's fascia was then also closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The area of the kidney at the base was covered with Surgicel prior to tying the sutures.  The bulldog clamp was removed and perfect hemostasis was evident.  There was no evidence of violation into the calyceal system.  A 19-French Blake drain was placed in the inferior aspect of the kidney exiting the left flank inferior to the incision.  The drain was anchored by using silk sutures.  The flank fascial layers were closed in three separate layers in the more medial aspect.  The lateral posterior aspect was closed in two separate layers using Vicryl sutures.  The skin was finally reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.","nephrology, renal mass, bovie, finochietto retractor, gerota's fascia, herniation, bulldog clamp, needle biopsy, nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy, renal cell carcinoma, retroperitoneum, vicryl suture, gerota's, kidney, partial, renal, sutures, vicryl,"

The patient's baseline creatinine was around 1.6 to 1.7.  The patient was found to have a 3 to 4-cm exophytic right renal mass, 1-cm renal mass inferior to that, and about 2-cm left renal mass.  Since the patient had bilateral renal disease and the patient had renal insufficiency, the best option at this time had been cryoprocedure for the kidney versus partial nephrectomy, one kidney at a time.  The patient understood all his options, had done some research on cryotherapy and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient had a renal biopsy done, which showed a possibility of an oncocytoma, which also would indicate that if this is not truly a cancerous lesion, but there is an associated risk of renal cell carcinoma that the patient will benefit from a cryo of the kidney.,Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, bowel obstruction, ileus, injury to bowel, postoperative bleeding, etc., were discussed.  The patient understood the risk of delayed bleeding, the needing for nephrectomy, renal failure, renal insufficiency, etc., and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE OR:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was given preoperative antibiotics.  The patient was bowel prepped.  The patient was placed in right side up, left side down, semiflank, with kidney rest up.  All the pressure points are very well padded using foam and towels.  The left knee was bent and the right knee was straight.  There was no tension on any of the joints.  All pressure points were well padded.  The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape all the way around.  A Foley catheter and OG tube were in place prior to prepping and draping the patient.  A periumbilical incision measuring about 6 cm was made.  The incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia using sharp dissection.  The peritoneum was open.  Abdomen was entered.  There were some adhesions on the right side of the abdomen, which were released using metz.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the anteroaxillary line and one in the midclavicular line.  A gel porter was placed.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  All ports were placed under direct vision, and the right colon was reflected medially.  Duodenum was cauterized.  Minimal dissection was done on the hilum and the Gerota's was opened laterally, and the renal masses were clearly visualized all the way around.  Pictures were taken.  Superficial biopsies were taken of 2 renal lesions using 3 different probes.  The 2 lesions were frozen.  The 2 probes were 2.4 mm and the other one was 3.1 mm in diameter.  So the R3.8 and R2.4 long probes were used.  Freezing/thawing, two cycles were done.  The temperatures were -131, -137, -150 and the freezing time was 5 and 10 minutes each and passive sign was done.  The exact times or exact temperatures are on the chart.  There was a nice ice ball with each freezing and with passive sign.  The probes were removed.,The probes were placed directly percutaneously through the skin into the renal lesions.,After freezing/thawing, the probes were removed and to seal with Surgicel were placed.  Pictures were taken after following total of 20 minutes were spent looking at the renal mass to make sure that there was no delayed bleeding.  From the time the probes were removed, until the time the laparoscope was removed, was total of 30 minutes.  So the masses were visualized for a total of 30 minutes without any pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained again.  Fibrin glue was placed over it just for precautionary measure.  There was about a total of 100 mL of blood loss overall with the entire procedure.  Please note that towels were used to prep off the colon and the liver to ensure there was no freezing of any other organ.  The kidney was kept in the left hand at all times.  Careful attention was drawn to make sure that the probe was deep enough, at least 3.5 to 4 cm in, to get the medial aspect of the tumors frozen.  The laparoscopic vacuum ultrasound showed that there was complete resolution of these lesions.  At the end of the procedure, after freezing/thawing and putting the fibrin glue, Surgicel, and EndoSeal, the colon was reflected medially.  Please note that the perirenal fat was placed over the lesion to ensure that the frozen area of the kidney was not exposed to the bowel.  Lap count was correct.  Please note that renal biopsy for permanent section was performed on the superficial aspect of the lesions.  No deeper biopsies were done to minimize the risk of bleeding.  The 12-mm ports were closed using 0-Vicryl and the middle incision.  The hand-port incision was closed using looped #1 PDS from both sides and was tied in the middle.  Please note that the pneumoperitoneum was closed using 0-Vicryl in running fashion.  After closing the abdomen, 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin and Dermabond was applied.,The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.","nephrology, hand-assisted laparoscopic cryoablation, laparoscopic, cryoablation, bilateral renal mass, fibrin glue, laparoscopic cryoablation, renal insufficiency, renal lesions, renal biopsy, renal mass, insufficiency, renal, freezing/thawing, lesions"

The patient was found to have a complex mass in the upper pole and the lower pole of the kidney.  MRI and CAT scan showed questionable renal mass, which could be malignant.  Initial plan was to let the patient stabilize for 2 weeks and perform the nephrectomy.  At this point, the patient was unable to go home.  The patient continually complained of pain.  The patient required about 3 to 4 units of blood transfusions prior.  The patient initially came in with hemoglobin less than 5.  The hemoglobin prior to surgery was 10.,Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, respiratory failure, morbidity and mortality of the procedure due to her low ejection fraction were discussed.  Cardiac clearance was obtained.  The patient was high risk, family and the patient knew about the risk.  The recommendation from the pulmonologist, cardiologist, and medical team was to get the kidney out at this point because the patient and the family stated that they would not do well at home without any intervention.  The patient and family understood all the risks and benefits in order to proceed with the surgery.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient had A-line triple-lumen catheter.  The patient was placed in left side up, right side down oblique position.  All the pressure points were well padded.  The right fistula was carefully padded completely around it.  Axilla was protected.  The fistula was checked throughout the procedure to ensure that it was stable.  The arms, ankles, knees, and joints were all padded with foam.  The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape.  OG and a Foley catheter were in place.  A supraumbilical incision was made about 6 cm in size and incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue and through the fascia and peritoneum was entered sharply.  There were some adhesions where the omentum was into the umbilical hernia, which was completely stuck.  The omentum was released out of that just so we could obtain pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained after using GelPort.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the left anterior axillary line, and mid clavicular line.  The colon was reflected medially.  Kidney was dissected laterally behind and inferiorly.  There was large hematoma visualized with significant amount of old blood, which was irrigated out.  Dissection was carried superiorly and the spleen was reflected medially.  The spleen and colon were all intact at the end of the procedure.  They were stable all throughout.  Using endovascular GIA stapler, all the medial and lateral dissection was carried through the stapler to ensure that the patient had minimal bleeding due to low cardiac reserve.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The renal vein and the renal artery were stapled and there was excellent hemostasis.,The dissection was carried lateral to the adrenal and medial to the right kidney.  The adrenal was preserved.  The entire kidney was removed through the hand port.  Irrigation was performed.  There was excellent hemostasis at the end of the nephrectomy.

The patient presents for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operative suite and administered general anesthetic.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion after building up the right side of the OR table to aid in the patient's positioning for bowel retraction.  Hassan technique was performed for the initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region.  Abdominal insufflation was performed.  There were significant adhesions noted.  A second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a Harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially.  The kidney was able to be palpated within Gerota's fascia.  The psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  The uterus was grasped with a Babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  The renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  There was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  We were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed.  The renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  Fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and Bovie cautery.  The tissue was sent down to Pathology for analysis.  Please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  Ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  The renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  At this point, the indwelling double-J ureteral stent was removed.  At this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 Vicryl suture was placed.  This was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  The back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, a double-J stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder.  The anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running Vicryl suture.  Renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place.  Please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue.  This was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 Vicryl.  FloSeal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this.  A good hemostasis was noted.  A #10 Blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis.  The initial trocar incision was closed with #0 Vicryl suture.  The abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 Vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin edges were then closed with staples.  Please note that all port sites were inspected prior to closing and hemostasis was noted at all sites and the fascia was noted to be reapproximated as these trocar sites were placed with the ________ obturator.  We placed the patient on IV antibiotics and pain medications.  We will obtain KUB and x-rays for stent placement.

He was discovered to have a MRSA bacteremia with elevated fever and had tenderness at the anterior chest wall where his Perm-A-Cath was situated.  He did require a short-term of Levophed for hypotension.  He is felt to have an infected dialysis catheter, which was removed.  He was planned to undergo replacement of his Perm-A-Cath, dialysis catheter, however, this was not possible.  He will still require a dialysis and will require at least a temporary dialysis catheter until which time a long-term indwelling catheter can be established for dialysis.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure previously.  He gave us informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  The left inguinal region was shaved.  His left groin was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing 1% lidocaine, the skin and subcutaneous tissue were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  Under direct aspiration technique, the left femoral vein was cannulated.  Next, utilizing an #18 gauge Cook needle, the left femoral vein was cannulated.  Sutures were removed, nonpulsatile flow was observed and a Seldinger guidewire was inserted within the catheter.  The needle was then removed.  Utilizing #11 blade scalpel, a small skin incision was made adjacent to the catheter.  Utilizing a #10 French dilator, the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and left femoral vein were dilated over the Seldinger guidewire.  Dilator was removed and a preflushed circle-C 8 inch catheter was inserted over the Seldinger guidewire.  The guidewire was retracted out from the blue distal port and grasped.  The catheter was then placed in the left femoral vessel _______.  This catheter was then fixed to the skin with #3-0 silk suture.  A mesenteric dressing was then placed over the catheter site.

The right arm, axilla, and chest wall were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Longitudinal skin incision was made from the lower axilla distally down the medial aspect of the arm and the basilic vein was not apparent.  The draining veins are the deep brachial veins.  The primary vein was carefully dissected out and small tributaries clamped, divided, and ligated with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  A nice length of vein was obtained to the distal one third of the arm.  This appeared to be of adequate length to transpose the vein through the subcutaneous tissue to an old occluded fistula vein, which remains patent through a small collateral vein.  A transverse skin incision was made over the superior aspect of the old fistula vein.  This vein was carefully dissected out and encircled with vascular tapes.  The brachial vein was then tunneled in a gentle curve above the bicep to the level of the cephalic vein fistula.  The patient was sensible, was then systemically heparinized.  The existing fistula vein was clamped proximally and distally, incised longitudinally for about a centimeter.  The brachial vein end was spatulated.  Subsequently, a branchial vein to arterialized fistula vein anastomosis was then constructed using running #6-0 Prolene suture in routine fashion.  After the completion of the anastomosis, the fistula vein was forebled and the branchial vein backbled.  The anastomosis was completed.  A nice thrill could be palpated over the outflow brachial vein.  Hemostasis was noted.  A 8 mm Blake drain was placed in the wound and brought out through inferior skin stab incision and ___ the skin with #3-0 nylon suture.  The wounds were then closed using interrupted #4-0 Vicryl and deep subcutaneous tissue ___ staples closed the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient was then x-ray'd and taken to Recovery in satisfactory condition.  Estimated blood loss 50 mL, drains 8 mm Blake.

The patient incidentally was in a car accident ten days ago and has been feeling pretty awful since that time.  He is slightly short of breath with mild difficulty in breathing.  A pre-procedure x-ray was obtained, which showed no pneumothorax.  He did have a significant right pleural effusion and a mild left pleural effusion.  We decided to insert the catheter on the right side.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine was used to anesthetize the area two fingerbreadths above the clavicle just posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and below the external jugular vein.  Using the same anesthetic needle, the right internal jugular vein was used to cannulate with good venous blood return.  The tract was noted.,The needle was removed and a second #18 gauge thin-walled needle was used along same tract to cannulate the right internal jugular vein also without difficulty and good venous blood return.  The syringe was removed and a Seldinger guidewire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the vein also without difficulty.  The needle was removed and an #11 blade was used to make a small skin incision provided skin and vein dilators were used.  The circle-C 8-inch hemodialysis catheter was then inserted over the guidewire without difficulty.  The guidewire was removed.  Both of the ports were aspirated venous blood without difficulty and both flushed also without difficulty.  The ports were flushed with injectable normal saline secondary to the patient going for dialysis today.  Thus, he will not need heparinization of the lines.  Again, he tolerated the procedure well.  A postoperative x-ray would be obtained to check catheter placement and rule out pneumothorax.","nephrology, uremia, internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheter, pneumothorax, jugular vein, dialysis, chronic renal failure, internal jugular vein, pleural effusion, hemodialysis catheter, renal failure, cannulate, guidewire, insertion, jugular, catheter, hemodialysis, vein"

He undergoes dialysis through the left forearm bridge fistula and has small pseudoaneurysms at the needle puncture sites level.  There is narrowing at the distal anastomosis due to intimal hypoplasia and the vein beyond it was of good quality.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the OR suite, placed in supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  Left arm was prepped and draped in appropriate manner.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was created just below the antecubital crease just deeper to the subcutaneous tissue.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissections segment of the fistula was isolated ________ vessel loop.  Transverse graftotomy was created.  A #4 Fogarty catheter passed proximally and distally restoring inflow and meager inflow.  A fistulogram was performed and the above findings were noted.  In a retrograde fashion, the proximal anastomosis was patent.  There was no narrowing within the forearm graft.  Both veins were flushed with heparinized saline and controlled with a vascular clamp.  A longitudinal incision was then created in the upper arm just deep into the subcutaneous tissue fascia.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissection, the brachial vein as well as distal anastomosis was isolated.  The distal anastomosis amputated off the fistula and oversewn with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture tied upon itself.  The vein was controlled with vascular clamps.

The patient recently underwent a fistulogram with angioplasty at the proximal upper arm cephalic vein due to a stenosis detected on Duplex ultrasound.  The patient subsequently was noted to have poor flow to the fistula, and the fistula was difficult to palpate.  A repeat ultrasound was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis involving the distal upper arm cephalic vein just distal to the brachial anastomosis.  The patient presents today for a left arm fistulogram with angioplasty.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient and understands and in agreement to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient was brought to the angio suite and laid supine on the table.  After sedation was administered, the left arm was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring were performed throughout the procedure.  The patient was given 1 g of IV Ancef prior to incision.,The left brachiocephalic fistula was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The cephalic vein in the proximal upper arm region appeared to be of adequate caliber.  There was an area of stenosis at the proximal cephalic vein just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The cephalic vein in the proximal forearm region was easily compressible.  The skin overlying the vessel was injected with 1% lidocaine solution.  A small incision was made with the #11 blade.  The cephalic vein then was cannulated with a 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath.  The sheath was advanced over the wire.  A fistulogram was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath over a 0.025 guide wire.  The sheath was aspirated and flushed with heparinized saline solution.  A 0.025 glidewire was then obtained and advanced, placed over the sheath and across the area of stenosis into the brachial artery.  A 5 French short Kumpe catheter was used to guide the wire into the distal brachial and radial artery.  After crossing the area of stenosis, a 5 x 20 mm standard angioplasty balloon was obtained and prepped from the back table.  This was placed over the glidewire into the area of stenosis and inflated to 14 mmHg pressure and then deflated.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated significant improvement.  However, there is still a remainder of residual stenosis.  The 5-mm balloon was placed over the wire again and a repeat angioplasty was performed.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and a repeat angiogram was performed which demonstrated again an area of stenosis right at the anastomosis.  The glidewire was removed and a 0.014 guide wire was then obtained and placed through the sheath and across the brachial anastomosis and into the radial artery.  A 4 x 20 mm cutting balloon was obtained and prepped on the back table.  The 5 French sheath was then exchanged for a 6 French sheath.  The balloon was then placed over the 0.014 guide wire into the area of stenosis and then inflated to normal pressures at 8 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and removed over the wire.  A 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was obtained and prepped and placed over the wire into the area of stenosis and inflated to pressures of 14 mmHg.  A repeat fistulogram was performed after the removal of the balloon which demonstrated excellent results with no significant residual stenosis.  The patient actually had a nice palpable thrill at this point.  The fistulogram of the distal cephalic vein at the subclavian anastomosis was performed which demonstrated a mild area of stenosis.  The sheath was removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.,After hemostasis was achieved, the cephalic vein again was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The proximal cephalic vein was then cannulated after injecting the skin overlying the vessel with a 1% lidocaine solution.  A 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath was then placed over the wire into the proximal cephalic vein.  A repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated an area of stenosis within the distal cephalic vein just prior to the subclavian vein confluence.  The 5 French introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath.  The 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was placed over a 0.035 glidewire across the area of stenosis.  The balloon was inflated to 14 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and a repeat fistulogram was performed through the sheath which demonstrated good results.  The sheath was then removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.  After adequate hemostasis was achieved, the area was cleansed in 2x2 and Tegaderm was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure without any complications.  I was present for the entire case.  The sponge, instrument, and needle counts are correct at the end of the case.  The patient was subsequently taken to PACU in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,  The initial left arm brachiocephalic fistulogram demonstrated a stenosis at the brachial artery anastomosis and distally within the cephalic vein.  After standard balloon angioplasty, there was a mild improvement but some residual area of stenosis remained at the anastomosis.  Then postcutting balloon angioplasty, venogram demonstrated a significant improvement without any evidence of significant stenosis.,Fistulogram of the proximal cephalic vein demonstrated a stenosis just prior to the confluence with the left subclavian vein.

He has undergone MRI of the abdomen on June 18, 2008 revealing an enhancing mass of the upper pole of the left kidney consistent with his history of renal cell carcinoma.  Of note, there are no other enhancing solid masses seen on this MRI.  After discussion of multiple management strategies with the patient including:,1.  Left partial nephrectomy.,2.  Left radical nephrectomy.,3.  Left renal cyst decortication.  The patient is likely to undergo the latter procedure.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to undergo left renal cyst decortication as well as a cystoscopy.  Intraoperatively, approximately four enlarged renal cysts and six smaller renal cysts were initially removed.  The contents were aspirated and careful dissection of the cyst wall was performed.  Multiple specimens of the cyst wall were sent for pathology.  Approximately one liter of cystic fluid was drained during the procedure.  The renal bed was inspected for hemostasis, which appear to be adequate.  There were no complications with the procedure.  Single JP drain was left in place.  Additionally, the patient underwent flexible cystoscopy, which revealed no gross strictures or any other abnormalities in the penile nor prostatic urethra.  Furthermore, no gross lesions were encountered in the bladder.

The patient was found to have lumbar diskitis and was going to require extensive antibiotic therapy, which was the cause of need for continued hospitalization.  He also needed to continue with dialysis and he needed to improve his rehabilitation.  The patient tolerated his medication well and he was going through rehab fairly well without any significant troubles.  He did have some bouts of issues with constipation on and off throughout his hospitalization, but this seemed to come under control with more aggressive management.  The patient had remained afebrile.  He did also have a bout with some episodic confusion problems, which appeared to be more of a sundowner-type of a problem, but this too cleared with his stay here at Promise.  On the day of discharge, on May 9, 2008, the patient was in good spirits, was very clear and lucid.  He denied any complaints of pain.  He did have some trouble with sleep at night at times, but I think this was mainly tied into the fact that he sleeps a lot during the day.  The patient has increased his appetite some and has been eating some.  His vital signs remain stable.  His blood pressure on discharge was 126/63, heart rate is 80, respiratory rate of 20 and temperature was 98.3.  PPD was negative.

He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria.  He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.,PROCEDURE: ,After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder.  The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.,Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder.  There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice.  A retrograde pyelogram was performed.  Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side.  At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire.  The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities.  The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire.  The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance.  The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter.  The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction.  The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed.  A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation.  The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system.  Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system.  The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass.  Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed.  The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis.  The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room.  It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy.  He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday.","nephrology, renal mass, hematuria, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, cystourethroscopy, retrograde, pyelogram, ureteral pyeloscopy, renal biopsy, double-j, ureteral stent placement, ureteropelvic junction, flexible scope, papillary mass, ureteral stent, renal pelvis, ureteral orifice, amplatz wire, retrograde pyelogram, ureteral, cystoscope, ureteroscope, renal, bladder"

The right ureteral opening was difficult to visualize, the left one was normal.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 78-year-old male with history of gross hematuria and recurrent UTIs.  The patient had hematuria.  Cystoscopy revealed atypical biopsy.  The patient came in again with gross hematuria.  The first biopsy was done about a month ago.  The patient was to come back and have repeat biopsies done, but before that came into the hospital with gross hematuria.  The options of watchful waiting, removal of the clots and biopsies were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT and PE were discussed.  Morbidity and mortality of the procedure were discussed.  Consent was obtained from the daughter-in-law who has the power of attorney in Florida.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient had been off of the Coumadin for about 4 days and INR had been reversed.  The patient has significant amount of clot upon entering the bladder.  There was a tight bladder neck contracture.  The prostate was not enlarged.  Using ACMI 24-French sheath, using Ellick irrigation about 2 cupful of clots were removed.  It took about half an hour to just remove the clots.  After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected.  This was lateral to the left ureteral opening.  The base was coagulated for hemostasis.  Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized.  The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal.  Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal.  The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots.  The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening.  A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation.  The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal.  At this time, a #24 three-way irrigation was started.  The patient was brought to Recovery room in stable condition.","nephrology, clot evacuation, transurethral resection, bladder tumor, bladder neck, gross hematuria, bladder, cystopyelogram, hematuria, clots,"

She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone.  She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter.  She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile.  She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia.  She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities.  The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter.  This was gently advanced to the mid ureter.  Urine was collected for cytology.  Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen.  This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter.  An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter.  The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis.  Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected.  The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level.  There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones.  The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate.  The ureteroscope was then removed.  The cystoscope was reinserted.  Once again, retrograde injection of contrast through an open-ended ureteral catheter was undertaken in the right ureter and collecting system.  No evidence of extravasation or significant change in anatomy was visualized.  The left ureteral orifice was then visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter, and retrograde injection of contrast demonstrated a normal left ureter and collecting system.  The cystoscope was removed.  Foley catheter was inserted.  The patient was placed in the supine position and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","nephrology, hydronephrosis, ureteropyelogram, ureterorenoscopy, flank pain, renal pelvis, urine cytology, ureteral, cystoscopy, barbotage, cystoscope, retrograde, urine, "

The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis.  CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place.  The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology.  The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.  Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics.","nephrology, infected stent, cysto stent removal, cysto stent, renal stone, lower pole, infected, stone, stent, cysto,"

Her last visit to this clinic was approximately three months ago.  Since that time, the patient states that she has had some variability in her glucose control too largely to recent upper and lower respiratory illnesses.  She did not seek attention for these, and the symptoms have begun to subside on their own and in the meantime, she continues to have some difficulties with blood sugar management.  Her 14-day average is 191.  She had a high blood sugar this morning, which she attributed to a problem with her infusion set; however, in the clinic after an appropriate correction bolus, she subsequently became quite low.  She was treated appropriately with glucose and crackers, and her blood sugar came back up to over 100.  She was able to manage this completely on her own.  In the meantime, she is not having any other medical problems that have interfered with glucose control.

His creatinine has ranged between 4 and 4.5 over the past 6 months, since I have been following him.  I have been trying to get him educated about end-stage kidney disease and we have been unsuccessful in getting him into classes.  On his last visit, I really stressed the importance of him taking his medications adequately and not missing some of the doses, and he returns today with much better blood pressure control.  He has also brought a machine at home, and states his blood pressure readings have been better.  He has not gone to the transplant orientation class yet and has not been to dialysis education yet, and both of these I have discussed with him in the past.  He also needs followup for his elevated PSA in the past, which has not been done for over 2 years and will likely need cardiac clearance if we ever are able to evaluate him for transplant.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Really negative.

He was last seen in this clinic on 05/29/2007 by Dr. X.  This is the first time that I have met the patient.  The patient's history of renal insufficiency dates back to 06/2006 when he was hospitalized for an HIV-associated complication.  He is unclear of the exact reason for his hospitalization at that time, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was followed in our Renal Clinic for approximately one year.  He had a baseline creatinine during that time of between 3.2 to 3.3.  When he was initially diagnosed with renal insufficiency, he had been noncompliant with his HAART regimen.  Since that time, he has been very compliant with treatment for his HIV and is seeing Dr. Y in our Infectious Disease Clinic.  He is currently on three-drug antiretroviral therapy.  His last CD4 count in 03/2008 was 350.  He has had no HIV complications since he was last seen in our clinic.

He shows no signs at this point of volume overload, although if he does demonstrate this in the future, his Lasix could be increased.  Goal blood pressure would be less than 130/80.,3.  Hyperkalemia.  I am going to instruct him in a low-potassium diet and decrease his valsartan to 20 mg daily.  I will have him return in one week to recheck his potassium.  If his potassium continues to remain elevated, he may require initiation of dialysis for this.,4.  Bone metabolism.  His PTH is elevated and I am going to add PhosLo 800 mg t.i.d. with meals.  His corrected calcium is 9.7, and I would like to avoid calcium-containing phosphate bonders in this situation.,5.  Acid base.  His bicarbonate is 18 and I will initiate the sodium bicarbonate 650 mg three tablets t.i.d.,6.  Anemia.  His hemoglobin is at goal for this stage of chronic kidney disease.

All the advantages, disadvantages, risks, and benefits of the procedure were explained to him for which he had consented.,ANESTHESIA,Monitored anesthesia care.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was identified, brought to the operating room, placed supine, and IV sedation given.  This was done under monitored anesthesia care.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  He received local infiltration of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine in the region of the proposed incision.,Incision was about 2.5 cm long between the cephalic vein and the distal part of the forearm and the radial artery.  Incision was deepened down through the subcutaneous fascia.  The vein was identified, dissected for a good length, and then the artery was identified and dissected.  Heparin 5000 units was given.  The artery clamped proximally and distally, opened up in the middle.  It was found to have Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis of a moderate intensity.  The vein was of good caliber and size.,The vein was clipped distally, fashioned to size and shape, and arteriotomy created in the distal radial artery and end-to-side anastomosis was performed using 7-0 Prolene and bled prior to tying it down.  Thrill was immediately felt and heard.,The incision was closed in two layers and sterile dressing applied.","nephrology, end-stage renal disease, av fistula, marcaine with epinephrine, monckeberg's, monitored anesthesia care, angiogram, arteriosclerosis, arteriovenous fistula, cephalic vein, ischemic cardiomyopathy, radial artery, subcutaneous fascia, arteriovenous, forearm, ischemic"

The right subclavian vein has an estimated 50% stenosis.  The patient has a catheter traversed in the right innominate vein.  The right basilic vein was judged to be suitable for usage on vein mapping.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS,The basilic vein was of an adequate size, but somewhat sclerotic.  A first stage autologous right brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula was created.  A grade 2 was felt at completion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The patient received regional nerve block.  The patient also received intravenous sedation.  The right arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  We used ultrasound to locate the basilic vein at the cubital fossa.,A small transverse incision was made slightly above the basilic vein.  The basilic vein was identified and immobilized.  The basilic vein was of a good size, but somewhat sclerotic.  The underlying fascia was incised and the brachial artery was identified and immobilized.  The brachial artery was normal.  We then divided the basilic vein distally.  The distal end was ligated using silk suture.  The brachial artery was clamped proximally and distally.  A small longitudinal arteriotomy was made in the brachial artery.  We did not give heparin.  The end of the basilic vein was then sewn end-to-side to the brachial artery using a running 7-0 Prolene suture.  ,Just prior to completion of the anastomosis, it was flushed and anastomosis was completed.  Flow was then established.  A grade 2 was felt in the outflow basilic fistula.  Hemostasis was secured.  The wound was then closed in layers using interrupted PDS sutures for the fascia and a running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture for the skin.  A sterile dry dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no operative complications.  The sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","nephrology, end-stage renal disease, left subclavian vein occlusion, arteriovenous fistula, artery bypass grafting, autologous, basilic vein, brachial artery, brachiobasilic, clamped, fistula, sclerotic, subclavian vein, subclavian vein stenosis, tracheostomy, brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula, subclavian vein occlusion, vein occlusion, subclavian, basilic, artery, "
